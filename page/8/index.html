        <p>We’ll get to Reasons Projects Succeed soon, but I need to do some setup work first. I’ve been thinking about starting an Open Source project for a while.  The only issue was; I didn’t have an idea for a project that didn’t already exist.  Now I do.  So, I’ve begun the process. The issue with starting a project like this is that I would much rather just start coding.  In fact, I would much rather not even make this Open Source.  But making it Open Source has forced me to face project management issues head on. I’ve been listening to enough podcast recently to know that putting something up on GitHub isn’t going to make a project Open Source any more than it will make it successful.  Therefor, I’ve decided to start the project as though it had a team of people already working on it.  It is a team of one for now.  But, one thing I’ve learned in life is that having the structure in place to handle a larger team now will not just benefit me in the future, but it will actually help my small little team of me today. I’ve started looking at other successful Open Source projects to see what they are doing and to determine what components of what they are doing I want to include in my project.  As I’ve gone through this exercise, the thought occurred to me, “If the organizations I’ve worked for implemented half of what these projects implement, the projects would have been run so much more efficiently and the projects that were in trouble may have avoided the trouble.” [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/image-5.png" alt="10 Reasons Projects Succeed" title="10 Reasons Projects Succeed"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/vuhung/8576985602/">Nguyen Vu Hung (vuhung)</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">Visual Hunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Clear-Mission-Statement"><a href="#Clear-Mission-Statement" class="headerlink" title="Clear Mission Statement"></a>Clear Mission Statement</h2><p>One of the most fundamental items that must exist in any project is a clear sense of what it is you are doing.  If you can’t explain what it is you are building in a couple of sentences, then how will you know when you are done?  How will you know you’ve succeeded? Once you’ve explained the summary, you might also want to go into some detail.  What makes this project different?  What problem does it solve?  What’s the short term vision?  Where might this project end up long term?  If there are other projects like this one, how is this one different? Why would anyone want to contribute to this tool?</p>
<h2 id="Clear-Expectations"><a href="#Clear-Expectations" class="headerlink" title="Clear Expectations"></a>Clear Expectations</h2><p>The thing that strikes me most about well-run projects is that they set clear expectations for people who will contribute to the project.  Here’s just a few items that are typically covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where to go if you have questions.  This typically includes email addresses, web sites, and other communication channels.  In a corporate setting you might also include phone numbers.</li>
<li>How to file a bug request.  Typically, you find this includes a line that says something about “steps to reproduce consistently”</li>
<li>How to ask for and/or add a new feature.  You’ll probably want to include something about making sure the feature gets accepted prior to working on it.</li>
<li>What constitutes “done” for a pull request.  Tests, documentation, code quality, etc.</li>
<li>Specific coding rules that need to be followed.  Even better if your style guide is automated in your build process and violations cause the build to fail.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Easy-Development-Environment"><a href="#Easy-Development-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Easy Development Environment"></a>Easy Development Environment</h2><p>This one drives me crazy.  In just about every organization I go to, setting up my development environment takes a day.  Some places it takes three days.  Simply because I don’t have rights, or the items I need are scatter here and there. Why not write the documentation for this, or better yet, take the time to write a script, that walks you through exactly how to get the development environment setup?  Life would be so much easier. And for places that already have this, when is the last time you verified that the instructions or script still worked?  Stuff changes and we barely notice until the new guy shows up.</p>
<h2 id="Continuous-Integration-Server"><a href="#Continuous-Integration-Server" class="headerlink" title="Continuous Integration Server"></a>Continuous Integration Server</h2><p>It sounds crazy in this world, but how many places still don’t have a continuous integration server.  And yet the most successful OS projects do.  Correlation?</p>
<h2 id="Unit-Tests"><a href="#Unit-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Unit Tests"></a>Unit Tests</h2><p>Testing.  We all hate it.  And here again, the best projects make sure there are test.  I’ve covered testing in multiple places before.  We’ll just leave this at, “You need tests!”</p>
<h2 id="Application-Level-Tests"><a href="#Application-Level-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Application Level Tests"></a>Application Level Tests</h2><p>And if you are writing an application, you need application level tests.  At least a few to make sure everything works together.</p>
<h2 id="Centralized-Communication"><a href="#Centralized-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Centralized Communication"></a>Centralized Communication</h2><p>It amazes me how many places still use email as the primary way of communicating.  What’s wrong with that?  Well, people get included who shouldn’t.  Don’t get included that should.  And finding the email when you need it is impossible.  Which version of the email has what you need anyhow? Most projects fail at the communication level.  There are tools for that.</p>
<h2 id="Project-Management-Tools"><a href="#Project-Management-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Project Management Tools"></a>Project Management Tools</h2><p>Find a project management tool and use it.  Actually, find a project management tool that your team will use and use it.  There is a lot of crap out there.  Don’t let the sales literature pick your tool.  Try the tool.  I’ve finally been introduced to a VERY popular tool where I’m working now.  I can’t believe it is so popular because I’ve used tools that are SO much better.  Better yet, find a useable tool that doesn’t just integrate with other tools, but merges with other tools.  You shouldn’t have to leave GitHub to use your Kanban board, for example.</p>
<h2 id="Swarms-vs-Silos"><a href="#Swarms-vs-Silos" class="headerlink" title="Swarms vs Silos"></a>Swarms vs Silos</h2><p>Here’s another places that drives me crazy.  Did you ever notice that in an Open Source project, the QA, Documentation and Coding all happen off of GitHub.  But in most organizations, those are all Silos?  What would happen if your QA, Documentation, and Coding people all worked out of the same space in your office.  In our situation, I have no idea if we even have documentation people.  We certainly don’t have QA people working WITH us daily.  And the programmers are even spread all over the place.  And we wonder why nothing gets done and we have communication problems.  We might as well work from home.  At least then there wouldn’t be an illusion that we were working together and we’d rely on collaboration tools more.</p>
<h2 id="Opt-In"><a href="#Opt-In" class="headerlink" title="Opt-In"></a>Opt-In</h2><p>OK.  This one is going to scare the managers.  But what would happen if the team of programmers where you worked were able to choose what projects they worked on?  I know in some places this wouldn’t work because there is only one project.  But in larger organizations? In most places, you get hired for a gig and then you get assigned to some project.  In some cases, you get hired for one project and assigned to another.   So even the choice you thought you had, you don’t have. Here are some advantages to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Poorly run projects would get abandoned.</li>
<li>Projects with no viable reason would get abandoned.</li>
<li>Programmers would work on things they enjoyed.</li>
<li><p>Product owners would have to contribute.</p>
<p><strong>What about you?  What do you think makes projects succeed or fail?  Leave a comment.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>

        <p>I was just getting started writing an article about using Node/JavaScript to drive my Selenium tests and as I was writing the “Prerequisite” section, I realized I have never written the basics about how to get setup with Node or even why you would want to. As popular as Node is, I am still finding that many of the people I work with have no idea what it is or if they do, they only have a partial idea and can’t see how it would apply to the work they do on a daily basis. So, let’s start with the fundamentals. [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”600”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/image-4.png" alt="You Can Start Using Node Today" title="You Can Start Using Node Today"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/stevendepolo/5749192025/">stevendepolo</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="What-is-Node"><a href="#What-is-Node" class="headerlink" title="What is Node?"></a>What is Node?</h2><p>I think the best place to start with our introduction is by providing a comprehensive view of what Node is.  A rather simplistic description would be, “Node is the V8 JavaScript engine from the Chrome browser, wrapped in an executable, that lets you run JavaScript without a browser.” Now, with that simplistic definition, you might think, “Why would I want to do that?”  Maybe you are assuming that this implementation only lets you do the same stuff that you can do in the browser.  And this is where you would be wrong. So, let’s start over. Node allows you to write cross platform applications that will run directly on your computer using JavaScript as the language. And now I hear everyone thinking, “Yeah, yeah, that was the promise of Java.” OK.  Maybe that’s true.  Time will tell.</p>
<h2 id="What-Can-You-Do-with-Node"><a href="#What-Can-You-Do-with-Node" class="headerlink" title="What Can You Do with Node?"></a>What Can You Do with Node?</h2><p>Several well-known applications use Node.  You may be surprised at how much node is already being used.  Here’s a short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many Web Servers</li>
<li>Desktop Applications</li>
<li>Developer Build Processes</li>
</ul>
<p>Does any of that surprise you? There is a <a href="//github.com/nodejs/node/wiki/Projects,-Applications,-and-Companies-Using-Node">long list of companies</a> who are using Node for some part of their development process or infrastructure.  Some more notable implementations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>VS Code by Microsoft – a code editor built using Node and Electron.</li>
<li>Slack Desktop App – uses Node and Electron</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, you can do just about anything you can think of.</p>
<h2 id="Installing-Node"><a href="#Installing-Node" class="headerlink" title="Installing Node"></a>Installing Node</h2><p>This falls under the category of “Things I wish I had known.” You can just go to the <a href="//nodejs.org/en/">Node site</a> and download the version you want to use.  But at some point, you are going to want to use multiple versions of Node.  One version for one project and a different version for some other project.  For that, you are going to need a tool called ‘NVM’.  Life will be a lot easier if you just install NVM first and then install Node from there. If you are running Windows, you’ll want to <a href="//github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases">grab NVM from here</a>.  Everyone else can <a href="//github.com/creationix/nvm">get NVM from here</a>. Once you have NVM installed, you should be able to run <code>nvm install _version.number.here_</code> or you can run <code>nvm install node</code> To install the latest version. You can run this command for each version you want to have installed. To see which versions are installed, you can run <code>nvm ls</code> And to use a specific version you can run <code>nvm use _version.number.here_</code></p>
<h2 id="Using-the-Node-Package-Manager"><a href="#Using-the-Node-Package-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Using the Node Package Manager"></a>Using the Node Package Manager</h2><p>When you installed Node, you also installed the Node Package Manager(NPM).  For those of you who are coming from the Microsoft world, NPM is like NuGet.  It is how we install additional “Modules” (think libraries) into our Node environment. The commands for NPM are pretty straight forward and most of the time, the documentation will tell you exactly what command to run to get it into your development environment.  But, it is helpful to know why you are running the various commands. But, before you start installing Node packages into your development environment, you are going to want a package.json file.  The easiest way to create this in a form that NPM can use is to use the command <code>npm init</code> which will walk you through all of the questions you need to answer to create a proper package.json file. The next command you are going to encounter is <code>npm install</code>. But <code>npm install</code> has several switches that you’ll be using.  Each with a different purpose. <code>npm install _packagename_</code> This will install the most recent version of the package into your node_modules directory and record the dependency in your package.json file in the dependencies section. If you want to be explicit about where you are saving the file you can use the <code>--save</code> flag.  It does the same thing as <code>npm install package</code>. <code>npm install --save _packagename_</code> Your other option for saving is <code>--save-dev</code>. This puts the dependency in the devDependencies section. You might wonder why you would have two different dependency sections. The reason for this is because you might have modules that you need simply to build the project. They aren’t needed when you deploy the project. So having the two different sections allows you to deploy without the extra set of modules.</p>
<h2 id="Node-JavaScript"><a href="#Node-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Node JavaScript"></a>Node JavaScript</h2><p>I once had someone assert that even within the same versions of JavaScript, there are different versions of JavaScript.  His main point was that there are differences between JavaScript on the browser and JavaScript in Node.  I assert, they are the same version of JavaScript, but the API that is available, or required, is different based on the environment. So, JavaScript on Node is syntactically no different than the JavaScript you write now.  However, Node does solve an age old problem we’ve had in client side code automatically. This problem is global scope pollution. If we write JavaScript that looks like this:</p>
<p>var a = ‘abc’;</p>
<p>Without wrapping the code in a function, the code will end up in global scope. The fix for this is to wrap all of our files in immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs).  I’ve written about using IIFEs before as a best practice for Angular programming.  In fact, it is a best practice for all client side JavaScript programming. But, in Node it is completely unnecessary because Node puts each file in its own scope.  Putting something on the global scope is something you have to do intentionally.  This is good, but it does require us to write some extra code. You see, the problem is, if all of the code we write is only local to the file we write it in, how are we going to be able to write code in a modular fashion?  We don’t want all of our code in one monolithic file.</p>
<h2 id="Modules"><a href="#Modules" class="headerlink" title="Modules"></a>Modules</h2><p>So, to handle this problem, Node implements two keywords/functions/variables (depends on how you think about it) We’ll just call them keywords for now. The first is the requires() keyword.</p>
<p>var foo = require(‘fooScript’);</p>
<p>This says go find the script “fooScript.js” and assign what was exported from it to our “foo” variable.  If the file you need to require has been installed with NPM, then all you need is the name of the module, like I did above.  But if you are requiring in a file from your own code, you’ll need to require using a path reference.  For you Windows people, this always works using forward slashes (/) not backslash (\). This probably leaves you asking the question, how does fooScript expose its content to the module requiring it? With code that looks like this:</p>
<p>module.exports = fooFunc;</p>
<p>This line normally appears at the end of a file.  In the case of the line above, assume that fooFunc is a function that is defined somewhere above the module.exports line. You could also write the exports using:</p>
<p>exports = fooFunc;</p>
<p>They do the same thing. If our fooFunc is in a file named “fooScript.js” then our foo variable above can call the fooFunc() function by using foo.</p>
<p>var foo = require(‘fooScript’);<br>foo(); // this line calls fooFunc() in fooScript.</p>
<h2 id="Optimizations"><a href="#Optimizations" class="headerlink" title="Optimizations"></a>Optimizations</h2><p>What took me a while to grasp is that you can export anything.  A function, a variable, an object.  It really doesn’t matter.  But you have to be aware of some optimizations that Node makes for you. You see, it would be pretty stupid to process the file every time it was required into another file.  So rather than do that, Node caches the export and assigns that the next time it is required.  If you export an object, the next time you require it, you will get the same object.  So an exported object becomes a singleton.  If you want to be able to create new objects, you are better off exporting the function (or class in ES2015) that creates the object and new-ing it up when you need it.</p>
<h2 id="Your-Turn"><a href="#Your-Turn" class="headerlink" title="Your Turn"></a>Your Turn</h2><p>So, now it is your turn.  If you have not tried using Node.js install it and try a few things.</p>

        <p>The MVVM design pattern has been around for quite a while now.  It has a lot of strengths when done correctly. But, I believe the time has come to recognize that MVVM has a lot of shortcomings that point to its demise.  Since I primarily develop web applications, I will keep this discussion centered on the use of MVVM in web applications.  The use of MVVM for desktop may or may not have these same issues. I realize that for some of you, the very suggestion of dropping MVVM will invoke a negative emotional response.  Some very smart people have quit their job at the suggestion that MVVM and its close cousin two-way data-binding, be abandoned in favor of another way.  But just for a few minutes, I would like for you to stop treating programming as a religion and consider the possibility that there may be a better way. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/image-2.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="History-of-MVVM"><a href="#History-of-MVVM" class="headerlink" title="History of MVVM"></a>History of MVVM</h2><p>MVVM was originally created by John Gossman to support the XAML syntax used to create Windows™ desktop applications and Silver Light applications.  Its main advantage has always been that it provides an easy way to decouple the View code from any business logic that might need to run.  Because of this decoupling, our applications become much easier to unit test. The next major implementation of MVVM that I can remember is <a href="//knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>.  It is the knockout framework that introduced me to MVVM and I have to say it is also the only one I feel like actually got it right.  By that I mean that it actually did what it was advertised to do.  Maybe that’s because of all the implementations I’ve used, Knockout is the only one that ONLY implemented MVVM rather than making it part of a larger framework.</p>
<h2 id="Definition-of-MVVM"><a href="#Definition-of-MVVM" class="headerlink" title="Definition of MVVM"></a>Definition of MVVM</h2><p>I’ve written about MVVM before where I’ve explained more completely what MVVM is.  But just so we have a working definition of what I mean when I talk about MVVM, let’s define it this way. MVVM is a design pattern that uses two-way data-binding to get data in and out of the presentation layer, referred to as the View, without the programmer needing to do any more than specifying that this should happen in the view.  MVVM is also able to have data elements and functions in the “ViewModel” track changes so that anything that is dependent on other data is automatically recalculated without the programmer having to write a lot of code to make this happen.  This creates a model that is able to respond to events in the view, but is primarily data centric rather than event centric has we have often reasoned about our applications in the past. It sounds great.  And when it works it is.  But that’s the main problem, it hardly ever works well.</p>
<h2 id="MVVM-Done-Right-is-Slow"><a href="#MVVM-Done-Right-is-Slow" class="headerlink" title="MVVM Done Right is Slow"></a>MVVM Done Right is Slow</h2><p>If you’ve had any experience or paid any attention to the implementation of MVVM using JavaScript, you will realize that the number one problem with MVVM is that it is a memory hog and performs poorly for all but the most trivial of applications.  In fact, for all of the popularity of Angular JS, the biggest complaint has been around the implementation of the data-binding.  In a large application, you might need to loop through the data multiple times to make sure it has all recalculated correctly.  If you just use the framework and let the framework deal with your sloppy code, this can make the system incredibly slow.  If you actually pay attention to what you are doing, it takes longer to implement than if you had chosen some other design pattern. But doing that means we have not moved on to…</p>
<h2 id="MVVM-is-Hard-to-Implement"><a href="#MVVM-is-Hard-to-Implement" class="headerlink" title="MVVM is Hard to Implement"></a>MVVM is Hard to Implement</h2><p>Recognizing that looping through the data until it stabilizes may not be a good idea, the framework designers have developed rules such as, “We’ll only run the digest cycle once.”  and “We’ll only run it when some user interaction has occurred.”  Well, OK.  That sounds good.  At least now it will be obvious that I have a problem.  But this is where the trouble begins.  If I can’t rely on my data, and ultimately my view, responding to changes in my data correctly, I am left with having to only partially implementing MVVM so that I can work around these limitations and using other means to make sure my view is updated correctly. This is to say nothing of many frameworks just not working as you would expect them to.</p>
<h2 id="MVVM-is-Hard-to-Reason-About"><a href="#MVVM-is-Hard-to-Reason-About" class="headerlink" title="MVVM is Hard to Reason About"></a>MVVM is Hard to Reason About</h2><p>Again, in all but the most trivial of applications, and because of the optimizations that various frameworks have tried to implement, MVVM becomes difficult to implement.  As I’ve tried to explain MVVM to others and even as I’ve tried to implement it myself, I’ve found that the simple act of keeping the view stuff in the view layer and the data stuff in the data layer and making sure it all updates appropriately has me, at times tearing my hair out.  Many times this is caused by incomplete implementations.  But if being hard to implement means it is hard to reason about, maybe we shouldn’t be using it to begin with.</p>
<h2 id="MVVM-is-Overkill"><a href="#MVVM-is-Overkill" class="headerlink" title="MVVM is Overkill"></a>MVVM is Overkill</h2><p>But it does work sometimes.  In really simple CRUD applications, it works great.  None of the problems I’ve mentioned.  And this is the great seduction of MVVM.  You try it on some small application and you get excited.  Like a gateway drug, it lures you in.  And when you finally go to implement it on some larger application, you find out that it really doesn’t scale all that well.  And on that small app you tried it on, couldn’t you have done that just as easily using another design pattern?</p>
<h2 id="Where-to-Go-from-Here"><a href="#Where-to-Go-from-Here" class="headerlink" title="Where to Go from Here"></a>Where to Go from Here</h2><p>As I was reviewing these arguments with a co-worker this week, he asked, “Are you saying we shouldn’t be using MVVM?”  And my answer might surprise you. I said, “Given the two models we have to work within the framework we are currently using, MVVM is the best choice.” However, what we might want to consider is moving to another framework that provides a better design pattern.  There are several “One-way” design patterns that intrigue me.  The first is the basic Flux pattern that React tends to use.  Done correctly, this uses events to achieve the decoupling we all should be striving for.  At its core, it is basic MVC. The second one, which is very flux like, is RxJS.  I’m still wrapping my head around how I to use it in an application and honestly don’t know enough about it at this point to say any more than that it looks interesting. And even if we decided to move away from MVVM, I think using two way data-binding between the view and the ViewModel is good.  I just think the ViewModel shouldn’t try to re-compute the values as part of what it does. Leave that to the developer to control.  The problem is, trying to get existing systems that implement two-way data-binding to only work at that level would not work correctly.  </p>

        <p>Coding Katas are a way of developing your skills as a programmer.  I thought it might be informative to tackle one of the classics as a blog post. Depending on how this works, I may or may not do another one quite so publicly. The rules I’m going to try to adhere by.</p>
<ol>
<li>I will document what I am doing as I go.</li>
<li>This is not a pre-coded blog post.  You’ll get to “see” me code as I go.</li>
<li>I will write all tests first.</li>
<li><p>I will only write enough code to make the current tests succeed.</p>
<p><img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/image-3.png" alt="Test Driven Kata - Roman to Arabic" title="Test Driven Kata - Roman to Arabic"> </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Today’s-problem"><a href="#Today’s-problem" class="headerlink" title="Today’s problem:"></a>Today’s problem:</h2><p>This is a pretty classic coding problem that shows up in interviews, home-work assignments, and code katas. As an interview problem, I find it lacking because it typically does not represent the kind of work you will be doing other than proving that you can solve problems in your chosen language.  It is also a standard coding problem, meaning the person interviewing you is using the most obvious problem to see if you can code.  Much like asking “What is your greatest strength?” and “What is your greatest weakness?”  Finally, it takes longer to complete than I believe interview coding problems should.  This is not to say, I don’t jump through these hoops myself. As a kata exercise, it is good because there are several ways you might solve the problem.  And for our purposes, it also demonstrates what Test Driven Development might look like using JavaScript. So, what is the problem? Write a function that converts Roman numbers into Arabic numbers and throws an error if the Roman number is in an invalid form. That sounds pretty easy.  But the first question we need to ask is, “What, exactly are the rules for converting Roman numbers into Arabic numbers?”</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The values for Roman numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>Roman</p>
<p>Arabic</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>L</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>D</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>100</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeating a number up to three times adds that value three times.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Roman ‘digit’ can’t repeat more than three times.  Instead the previous 1, 10, or 100 equivalent value is used to subtract from the next ‘digit’.  That is,</p>
<p>Roman</p>
<p>Arabic</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>IX</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>XL</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>XC</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>CD</p>
<p>400</p>
<p>CM</p>
<p>900</p>
</li>
<li><p>With the exception of the subtraction rule above, all values must decrease in scale from left to right and are added together.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Test-1"><a href="#Test-1" class="headerlink" title="Test 1"></a>Test 1</h2><p>Since we will be using JavaScript, the testing framework we will be using is Jasmine. Our first test will simply test that when we pass in “I” we get back 1. Since there is no way of embedding GitHub repository files into WordPress that I know of, and I’m too lazy to create a gist for each step along the way, I’ll just provide links to the source at the various points along the way.  If you know of a way to directly include the source files, let me know in the comments. So, here is the first link: <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the code that passes this test is here: <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a> You might think, what’s the point?  Why just return 1 when you know you are going to have to do more?  Well, when you are doing TDD, you have to work off of what you are testing for now, not what you might test for later.  So, we return 1.</p>
<h2 id="Test-2"><a href="#Test-2" class="headerlink" title="Test 2"></a>Test 2</h2><p>From here, we can go a couple of different directions.  How about testing for rule 3 next.  How would we do that? To start with, we might just make sure that if we pass in IV, we get back 4.  Now our code is getting a bit more complicated.  But sticking with our TDD principles, we’ll just test for IV.  Another happy path test. Here is the code that test for our two conditions: <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the code that implements it <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Test-3"><a href="#Test-3" class="headerlink" title="Test 3"></a>Test 3</h2><p>OK.  What happens if IV shows up twice?  That should be a failure.  IV should never show up more than once.  In fact, none of the codes that show up in rule three should show up more than once.  Let’s make sure they don’t. The tests for this will be pretty simple, and to save time, we will code for all of them at once.  In fact, we are going to eventually need the conversion tables above, so let’s go ahead and put them in now. Here is what our test file looks like now.  Notice that we’ve put several tests in at once. Notice that I didn’t have to write multiple tests to do this.  I just created one test and iterated over it. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the solution also iterates. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Test-4"><a href="#Test-4" class="headerlink" title="Test 4"></a>Test 4</h2><p>Just to make sure we aren’t counting how many times in a row this all shows up, let’s add a valid Roman Number in between. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-4/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-4/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-4/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> Look at that, it all still works!</p>
<h2 id="Test-5"><a href="#Test-5" class="headerlink" title="Test 5"></a>Test 5</h2><p>Next, we need to make sure that none of the items in our base table show up more than 3 times.  We’ll write a similar test to what we’ve already written with a twist.  If any of those numerals show up more than 4 times, we know we have a problem either because they are out of order or because they show up all in a row.  So, we only need to check the count.  If there are four of any of them, we have a problem. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the code to implement it. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Test-6"><a href="#Test-6" class="headerlink" title="Test 6"></a>Test 6</h2><p>So, before we move on to actually computing the value of the Roman number, we should ask ourselves if there are any other ways a Roman number could be passed in incorrectly. The next one that occurs to me is this.  If you have a number that contains a ‘digit’ from the minusOneTable, the character that is used to subtract should never follow the digit.  For example, if “IV” shows up, there shouldn’t not be an “I” immediately after it.  That is, we shouldn’t see “IVI” anywhere in our string.  So let’s add that to our tests. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the code to implement it <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-7"><a href="#Step-7" class="headerlink" title="Step 7"></a>Step 7</h2><p>There is one more possible problem we could encounter.  What if someone passes in a character that isn’t a valid Roman number character.  We need to make sure that the only characters that show up are Roman number characters. Since testing for all of the characters isn’t practical, we are just going to test for a few and assume that if this were a real business problem we’d go to the trouble of testing more.  But, the basic test is going to look the same.  Toss in bad characters in an otherwise valid string and make sure we throw an error. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the solution, which is pretty simple. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-8"><a href="#Step-8" class="headerlink" title="Step 8"></a>Step 8</h2><p>OK. I think that gets all of the validations except for ensuring that the numbers show up in numerical order.  To make this work, we are going to need to work through the array and assign each digit a value.  The test we need to write is going to put values in the wrong order. Our test will put the next value up after the value. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the solution will put them in order and add them along the way. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-9"><a href="#Step-9" class="headerlink" title="Step 9"></a>Step 9</h2><p>And finally we add some test to verify that we get the right result. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-9/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-9/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-9/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Review"><a href="#Review" class="headerlink" title="Review"></a>Review</h2><p>What?! I thought we were done? Well, we are and we aren’t.  We have code that works.  But is it the best code we can write? Here is what I like about this code:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is easy to reason about.</li>
<li>It allows me to add additional roman numbers by expanding my tables.  No additional code would be needed. (And while it is hard to represent using Arabic letters, there are additional symbols.)</li>
<li>It works reasonably fast.</li>
</ol>
<p>But, it does seem to me that we might make it a bit more efficient without sacrificing these advantages too much.  And the great news is, since we have our test in place, we can refactor with impunity.  No worries about breaking something because we will know as soon as we have and we can revert back to the code that was working.</p>
<h2 id="Step-12"><a href="#Step-12" class="headerlink" title="Step 12"></a>Step 12</h2><p>One pretty simple change we can make is that our error message is scattered throughout our code.  Let’s make that a variable and just throw the variable. The other thing I wonder about is how much of our validations can be combined? One check we might safely eliminate at this point is the check to make sure the minus values only show up once.  If any of them were to show up more than once, they would either show up one after the other, which we still can check for, or they would be in the wrong value order which our final check will catch.  So, let’s eliminate that code as well and re-run our tests to make sure nothing broke. And now that we’ve eliminated that check, we can create one big string for checking conditions like “IVI” into one string and check it once instead of creating a new RegExp object multiple times. Here is the code we have so far: <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-10/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-10/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-10/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-11"><a href="#Step-11" class="headerlink" title="Step 11"></a>Step 11</h2><p>Now that we have our IVI check down to one string, it occurs to me that we can combine this check with our invalid character check.  So, let’s do that next. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-11/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-11/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-11/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-12-1"><a href="#Step-12-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 12"></a>Step 12</h2><p>And the last place we can optimize is our three digit check.  But instead of limiting it to valid Roman numbers, let’s just check for any sequence of characters that repeats 4 times or more. And once we know that is working, we can combine it with our other Regular Expressions. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-12/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-12/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-12/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-13"><a href="#Step-13" class="headerlink" title="Step 13"></a>Step 13</h2><p>We’ve cleaned up about all of the logic we can without hard coding the values.  But I would like to combine the lookup tables next.  I don’t like having three tables.  Let’s see if we can pull those into one table. The first step to doing this is combining the minusOneTable and baseTable into one table.  To differentiate in the code that is using those tables, we’ll just look at the length of the property. In the process of doing this, we notice that it would also make sense to combine the substitution table.  And since the values we’ve assigned to the table aren’t even being used at this point, we’ll just use the substitutions instead of the values. And if we make the value of each element in the baseTable an array, we could combine the values into that table as well.  But that would over complicate our lookup logic when we compute the value.  So, I think we’ll just leave that as it is. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-13/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-13/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-13/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-14"><a href="#Step-14" class="headerlink" title="Step 14"></a>Step 14</h2><p>Finally, I think we want to consolidate the loops into one loop. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-14/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-14/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Review-1"><a href="#Review-1" class="headerlink" title="Review"></a>Review</h2><p>There are probably a few other optimizations that could be made here.  But I’m afraid that each would sacrifice either the flexibility.  That is, we could hard code the regular expression validations, which would significantly reduce the number of lines of code.  Or we would sacrifice the readability.  Neither of which I am willing to do. If you are only interested in the result, you can find the finished project at. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas</a></p>

        <p>I’ve worked with Ext JS now for a total of 2.5 years.  First with Ext 4.2 and now with Ext 6.x. Here’s my experience, and warning, of why you should avoid this disaster of a framework. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/image-1.png" alt="7 Reasons To Evade Ext JS" title="7 Reasons To Evade Ext JS"> </p>
<h2 id="Jack-of-All-Trades"><a href="#Jack-of-All-Trades" class="headerlink" title="Jack of All Trades"></a>Jack of All Trades</h2><p>Master of none! One of the great selling points of using Ext JS is the fact that it comes with “Everything you need” to build a web application.  That would be great if it were true.  But the fact of the matter is, it comes with all of the features you need but the features are all only partially implemented.  I’ve complained publicly several times that Sencha can’t possibly be testing the code they release because it only works in their demos.  If you try to use a feature they have documented as being available, you are likely to find that the feature doesn’t actually work.  How is it possible that you’ve written documentation for how something is supposed to work and yet you can release it without it working properly?  I can understand fringe stuff getting by.  We can’t think of every test.  But when this happens over and over again, you start to wonder what exactly they are testing.</p>
<h2 id="A-Wolf-in-Sheep’s-Clothing"><a href="#A-Wolf-in-Sheep’s-Clothing" class="headerlink" title="A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing"></a>A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing</h2><p>When I first started with Ext, the only design pattern they had available was what they referred to as MVC.  It took me two months of playing with the framework before I finally realized that what they were calling MVC wasn’t anything the <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/designPatterns">Gang of Four</a> would recognize as MVC.  I guess if you have a View, a Model and a Controller, you can call it MVC?  It doesn’t matter that the Models define records in a table or that the Controller is tightly coupled to your view.</p>
<h2 id="Sheep-Without-Legs"><a href="#Sheep-Without-Legs" class="headerlink" title="Sheep Without Legs"></a>Sheep Without Legs</h2><p>OK.  So when they introduced the MVVM architecture I actually started to have just a bit of hope.  Yes, there were still some fundamental issues I have, but MVVM would make this tolerable.  But here is the issue.  Their idea of MVVM is that you would only need to implement it on a per page basis. Let me try to explain.</p>
<h3 id="Broken-Data-Binding"><a href="#Broken-Data-Binding" class="headerlink" title="Broken Data Binding"></a>Broken Data Binding</h3><p>In my ideal world, when I build a new component, I would build that component using the framework the rest of my application is using.  So my component uses MVVM.  Sencha’s implementation gives you a View, ViewController, and ViewModel.  Mostly this looks more like MVC if you ask me but whatever, it has two-way databinding, so we’ll call it MVVM for now.  If you build a component that lives inside another component, the first thing you’ll discover is that binding only works from the top down.  That is, I can bind data at the outer layer and it will get reflected all of the way in to the inner most component that uses it.  But, if you change the data in the inner most component, it doesn’t reflect back up to the outer most component.  I’ve written a hack for this, and there is no promise from Sencha that this will ever get fixed properly, so I guess my hack is safe.</p>
<h3 id="Broken-Controllers"><a href="#Broken-Controllers" class="headerlink" title="Broken Controllers"></a>Broken Controllers</h3><p>But it gets worse.  While child components can find data in models that are in parent components properly, they can’t find references to functions in controllers in the same way.  This is particularly problematic if you write a component that is a container of other components.  You would naturally want the child components to use the controller from the component that they were declared in.  But if you have an outer component that has your container component as a child and then other components inside of that.  The only way you can control what controller the child most components are going to notify of events is by wrapping the inner most components in their own component with their own controller.  This gets to be awkward when all you want to do is provide an event handler for one control in a column of a grid control.  Again, I have a monkey patch that fixes this, but why did I have to write it? This is just one specific example of my “Jack of All Trades” point that I started with. We won’t even address the question of if this is really MVVM or not!</p>
<h2 id="Never-Use-the-0-release"><a href="#Never-Use-the-0-release" class="headerlink" title="Never Use the .0 release"></a>Never Use the .0 release</h2><p>I think most of us now are generally conditioned to be wary of the .0 release of anything that hasn’t been developed using Open Source methods.  There just haven’t been enough eyes on the project to ensure that everything works as it should. But with Sencha, this extends to all of the patch releases at the very least and even into some minor releases. While the 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 releases were unacceptably broken, we find that every new patch or minor release that comes out afterward breaks something that was working.  We always have to ask, “Can we live with this?”</p>
<h2 id="All-or-Nothing"><a href="#All-or-Nothing" class="headerlink" title="All or Nothing"></a>All or Nothing</h2><p>As I said at the beginning, Sencha gives you everything.  That sounds good.  You won’t have to go looking for a grid control, or many other common controls you might want to use. But the bad news is, you can only use controls that were written to be used with Ext.  Which other than what Sencha provides in the framework, doesn’t give you a lot of choices.  Don’t go thinking you’ll supplement Ext with a selection of third party controls.  It’s not going to happen.</p>
<h2 id="Fences-Protect-AND-Isolate"><a href="#Fences-Protect-AND-Isolate" class="headerlink" title="Fences Protect AND Isolate"></a>Fences Protect AND Isolate</h2><p>Up until this point in my post, no one can reasonably argue that anything I’ve said is actually a benefit.  At this point we switch to points that may vary based on how well you know JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You see, the good news, and actually a major selling point to many people, is that you can write a web application using Ext without having to know much, if anything about HTML or CSS.  And for that matter even the amount of JavaScript you need to know is relatively limited. That’s the good news.  The bad news is, if you know anything about any of these, you’ll probably end up frustrated by EXT.  This is because Ext’s JavaScript controls most of the layout.  So if you are used to going into developer tools to tweak the CSS and then applying that to your style sheet, you are going to be very disappointed.  Pretty much nothing you do in developer tools is going to work as you would expect.  And figuring out how to apply those to your code is going to be a lot harder than you are used to.</p>
<h2 id="Their-Way-or-the-Highway"><a href="#Their-Way-or-the-Highway" class="headerlink" title="Their Way or the Highway"></a>Their Way or the Highway</h2><p>Once again, many people see this as an advantage.  And once again if you aren’t familiar with how the rest of the JavaScript world does things, this is going to sound fine.</p>
<h3 id="Sencha-CMD"><a href="#Sencha-CMD" class="headerlink" title="Sencha CMD"></a>Sencha CMD</h3><p>Everything runs through Sencha CMD.  A tool for building all things Ext.  If you want to bundle and minify your code, the standard way of doing this is by using “requires” statements in your code and then running Sencha CMD and have it figure out what you are using and put it all in one bundle. The problem with this is that there are several much better ways of doing this that are available using Node and various NPM packages.  Again, if you are a JavaScript developer, you are going to wonder what Sencha is thinking.</p>
<h3 id="Ext-define"><a href="#Ext-define" class="headerlink" title="Ext.define()"></a>Ext.define()</h3><p>Another place where proprietary shows up is in how Ext defines “Classes”.  When it was first introduced, TypeScript was new.  But now, we not only have TypeScript, which does much of what Ext does and some things it doesn’t, but we have an evolving JavaScript standard that I’m afraid Sencha won’t be able to keep up with.  They already discourage the use of ‘use strict’;.  Once again, there is only one place where this will get you in trouble, and the work around actually produces more efficient code.  But still, the point is, Sencha is relying on ECMA Script 3 standards while the world has largely moved on to ECMA 2015 and beyond. Anyhow, my point here is that Ext is not just a framework but also functions, largely, as its own language.  Not quite as much a fork from the standard as Coffee Script, but also not nearly as close to the JavaScript spec as TypeScript.  So while it is still JavaScript, if you are a JavaScript programmer, it isn’t going to feel quite like JavaScript to you.</p>
<h3 id="Themes"><a href="#Themes" class="headerlink" title="Themes"></a>Themes</h3><p>The final place you will find “Proprietary” lurking is with the Themes.  There are several really good CSS frameworks out there.  Sencha uses none of them.  And while the syntax they use for creating themes has been SASS up until Ext 6, now they even have their own proprietary SASS compiler.  Watch out here because they are still using the SASS extensions so you are likely to make some assumptions here that aren’t true because, once again, they’ve only implemented enough of the SASS engine to do what THEY need to do.</p>
<h2 id="VB-All-Over-Again"><a href="#VB-All-Over-Again" class="headerlink" title="VB All Over Again"></a>VB All Over Again</h2><p>Every time I hear someone praise how great Ext is, it is normally because it has everything you need out of the box and allows you to get stuff done quickly.  Basically the same argument for using Visual Basic back in the day.  And yet I learned to never take a VB job because it almost every instance, while it was possible to write well structured code in Visual Basic, it was generally so difficult to do that the code I would be maintaining would need to be rewritten in order to make any sense of it. Ext suffers the same issue.  There is nothing in Ext to force you to write well structured code.  The code I have had to maintain has almost always followed every anti-pattern known to man.  In this case, this isn’t Sencha’s fault directly other than the fact that the only reason my code tends to be cleaner than most is because I’m more likely to code a fix to an Ext bug than I am to work around the problem with an anti-pattern. In comparison to other frameworks that are available, if all you want is a tool that will get you a semi working application quickly, and you don’t care so much about having to rewrite it when you need to change it in some way, Ext is your tool.  If on the other hand, you care about design and you want to be able to maintain what you’ve written, you should look elsewhere. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>

        <p>Several weeks ago, I wrote about <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/why-does-javascript-loop-only-use-last-value/">how closures impact calling asynchronous functions</a> in a loop and several ways of dealing with that problem. In my recent coding, I’ve discovered an even more simple way of dealing with this problem. In the process, it removes the anonymous function and eliminates the linting error, ‘Don’t make functions within a loop’ You see, I’ve been experimenting with JavaScript <code>bind()</code>. And as it turns out, we can use bind in multiple situations, including dealing with the closure issue I mentioned a couple of weeks ago. [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/image.png" alt="JavaScript bind() for cleaner code" title="JavaScript bind() for cleaner code"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/connortarter/4754231502/">Connor Tarter</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="What-Is-bind"><a href="#What-Is-bind" class="headerlink" title="What Is bind()?"></a>What Is bind()?</h2><p>The bind function is a recent addition to the JavaScript spec. So this will only work on recent browsers. You can <a href="//kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/">check the compatibility table</a> (for all things JavaScript) to see which browser implement <code>bind()</code> as well as other JavaScript features. I looked over the list and there aren’t any browsers that don’t support <code>bind()</code> that I care to support, so I’m good. Your mileage may vary. What bind does is that it automatically wraps your function in its own closure so that we can bind the context (the this keyword) and a list of parameters to the original function. What you end up with is another function pointer. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/d258dbdc23c846fde767ad6143771a53#file-bind1-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/d258dbdc23c846fde767ad6143771a53#file-bind1-js</a> Notice that we not only bound this to the <code>foo()</code> function, but we also bound the two parameters. So, when we call <code>newFoo()</code> the return value will be 7. But what happens if we change the parameters before calling newFoo?</p>
<h2 id="Changing-bind-parameters"><a href="#Changing-bind-parameters" class="headerlink" title="Changing bind parameters"></a>Changing bind parameters</h2><p>If we bind parameters to <code>foo()</code> using variables and then change the variables prior to calling <code>newFoo()</code>, what do you expect the value to be? <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/d258dbdc23c846fde767ad6143771a53#file-bind2-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/d258dbdc23c846fde767ad6143771a53#file-bind2-js</a> The return value is still going to be 7 because <code>bind()</code> binds the value of the parameters, not the actual variables. This is good news and, like I said, we can use this to great advantage in our code. But where I think it will display the most usefulness to me is in my call backs</p>
<h2 id="Bind-and-callbacks"><a href="#Bind-and-callbacks" class="headerlink" title="Bind and callbacks"></a>Bind and callbacks</h2><p>You should remember from that article that one of our solutions to dealing with callbacks in loops was to create an anonymous function around the function we wanted to call. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-sol1-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-sol1-js</a> But we can greatly simplify this code by using bind instead. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/d258dbdc23c846fde767ad6143771a53#file-bind3-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/d258dbdc23c846fde767ad6143771a53#file-bind3-js</a> We can do this because each call to bind gives us a new function pointer and the original function remains unchanged. Meanwhile, we also remove the linting error ‘Don’t make functions within a loop’ because we aren’t creating the function in a loop, we are just pointing to a function that was created outside of the loop.</p>
<h2 id="Bind-for-Event-Handlers"><a href="#Bind-for-Event-Handlers" class="headerlink" title="Bind for Event Handlers"></a>Bind for Event Handlers</h2><p>Another place where <code>bind()</code> will clean up your code is with event handlers.  Everyone knows, or should know, that when an event handler is called, the context it is called on is the thing that generated the event and not the object that the event handler was created in.  But, by using bind, you can be sure that the function is being called on the correct context. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/d258dbdc23c846fde767ad6143771a53#file-bind4-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/d258dbdc23c846fde767ad6143771a53#file-bind4-js</a> Not that you would write your code exactly like that, but that is just to get the point across.</p>
<h2 id="Currying"><a href="#Currying" class="headerlink" title="Currying"></a>Currying</h2><p>What?! OK.  I’ll be the first to admit that my functional programming knowledge is limited.  But the best definition of Currying I can give you is that it allows you to pass parameters to function in multiple steps. Using binding, we achieve Currying by writing code that looks something like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/d258dbdc23c846fde767ad6143771a53#file-currying-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/d258dbdc23c846fde767ad6143771a53#file-currying-js</a></p>

        <p>Over the last several years, I’ve had a chance to read a few Programming Resumes.  Or, I should say, TRY to read a few resumes.  But frankly, if the Programming Resume I typically see is common, everyone who reads my blog needs this advice.  I haven’t seen a barely adequate resume in years.  And I’m sick of it.  Oh, it’s good for me of course.  I know my resume is going to stand out as such a unique work of art compared to the others, that I will get a call back right away.  After all, if the competition is so incredibly weak, I don’t even need to try. On the other hand, as someone who has to read these resumes, I’d like to have something better. And no, I’m not going to go over the standard “how to make your resume awesome” stuff because evidently most programmers can’t even get the basics down.  Seriously! [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/image-3.png" alt="Your Programming Resume is GARBAGE!" title="Your Programming Resume is GARBAGE!"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/ollesvensson/2443240690/">ollesvensson</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">Visualhunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Your-Programming-Resume-is-Too-Long"><a href="#Your-Programming-Resume-is-Too-Long" class="headerlink" title="Your Programming Resume is Too Long!"></a>Your Programming Resume is Too Long!</h2><p>I struggled for years to keep my resume down to two pages until I started seeing resumes from people with MUCH less experience than me that were 8 and 9 pages long.  And I thought my 4 pager was too long! Here’s a valuable tip.  No one really cares who you worked for 10 years ago.  Even if you are a contract programmer like I am and you tend to switch gigs once every year or so.  If you haven’t done it in the last year, I really don’t need a lot of detail about it.  What have you done recently?! Here’s what happens when I see an 8 pager.  I scan it for the buzz words I’m interested in and I see how often they show up.  I then try to see if I can discern how much you really know other than how to spell the buzzword.</p>
<h2 id="Your-Resume-Has-NO-White-Space"><a href="#Your-Resume-Has-NO-White-Space" class="headerlink" title="Your Resume Has NO White Space"></a>Your Resume Has NO White Space</h2><p>You need lots of this.  Just like in music, the rest are part of the music.  If nothing stands out in your resume, how am I supposed to tell what you are capable of doing?</p>
<h2 id="Did-you-try-to-USE-a-Word-Processor"><a href="#Did-you-try-to-USE-a-Word-Processor" class="headerlink" title="Did you try to USE a Word Processor?"></a>Did you try to USE a Word Processor?</h2><p>I’m sure you are thinking, “yeah, I did” But from the resumes I’ve seen it barely looks like you used more than an old fashion type writer.  There are two issues here.  First, your document is boring.  This goes along with the white space issue.  Once again, how can I tell what is important if it is all the same font and all jammed together?  Print out your resume.  Forget for a second that this is your resume.  Squint your eyes or otherwise look at it without being able to see the characters.  What stands out?  Does anything stand out?  What do you want people to focus on? The second issue here is this.  If you can’t use the basic features of a Word Processor, how good of a Programmer are you really?!</p>
<h2 id="Lack-of-Organization"><a href="#Lack-of-Organization" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Organization"></a>Lack of Organization</h2><p>This one is a little subtler.  I’m sure most people think their resumes are organized.  Most of what I see looks like this: The first page has some form of a “summary” of what the person has done.  Generally, a lot of bullet points that look no different than the same information they put in the work history. The next seven or more pages have the work history with bullets under each with what the person did. But here is my problem.  You are making me wade through that first section to see if you did anything I’m interested in.  It would be so much easier if you organized those bullets a bit.  Again, white space, different fonts.</p>
<h2 id="You-Have-too-many-Bullets-per-Job"><a href="#You-Have-too-many-Bullets-per-Job" class="headerlink" title="You Have too many Bullets per Job"></a>You Have too many Bullets per Job</h2><p>Yeah.  I did this too.  But it was for a place I worked at for 8 years.  There was a lot to tell.  But then I realized, no one cares. Here is all I care about with your work history.  What technology did you use?  Did you do something interesting?  And bonus points if you can tell me what value you provided.  Who are you beyond what technology you know? My current format has two bullets for each assignment that emphasize my strengths as a programmer generally.  This is the value I provided. The third bullet is the list of technology I used at that assignment.  This is because, while I’ve listed all the tech I know at the top, I believe most places want to know where I got the experience.  I know I would.</p>
<h2 id="Multiple-Short-Gigs"><a href="#Multiple-Short-Gigs" class="headerlink" title="Multiple Short Gigs"></a>Multiple Short Gigs</h2><p>A recent programming resume I saw had multiple 3 and 4 month assignments.  This is a HUGE warning flag.  Anyone looking at your resume is going to take one look at that and all kinds of warning bells are going to go off in their head.  Especially if you can’t explain why they were short.  Maybe they weren’t your fault.  But let me tell you what is going on at the hiring side.  We do a tech interview, the person comes in and we find out they have no clue how to do anything we hired them for.  If you have multiple short assignments, the first thing we think is, “He has to be lying about what he can do.” Then again, if you are lying about what you can do, why not lie about how long you worked some place?  Not that I’m suggesting that.  We’ll find out soon enough.  But if you are already lying…</p>
<h2 id="Only-What-You-Know"><a href="#Only-What-You-Know" class="headerlink" title="Only What You Know"></a>Only What You Know</h2><p>This should be obvious, but I see so many resumes that have exactly what we are looking for and then when we give a simple coding exercise, they can’t do the exercise. We aren’t trying to trip you up.  Just prove you’ve done something with the technology before.  Please. Just as a recent example. We did a phone screen with a guy and we asked him several very technical questions.  No code.  Just, “what can you tell me about X” kind of questions.  And he answered all of them in very intricate detail.  He sounded really good.  But after a half hour of this, you start to wonder.  “If he is THIS smart, why is he interviewing for THIS job?”  It isn’t like we are any of the really big tech companies. When we finished the phone screen, I told the guy I was doing the interview with, “He’s either wicked smart or he was reading.”  Well, there is only one way to find out.  Do a face to face where he can’t read.  Only we couldn’t do that because he lived too far away.  So the next best thing was a skype interview with a shared code screen. All we asked the guy to do was a simple object oriented abstraction exercise.  OOP 101.  It became clear that he didn’t have any clue about how to do Object Oriented Programming nor did he know anything about any of the technology we were going to ask him to do. I guess this must work some of the time because we keep seeing this.</p>
<h2 id="Keep-On-Generating-Garbage"><a href="#Keep-On-Generating-Garbage" class="headerlink" title="Keep On Generating Garbage"></a>Keep On Generating Garbage</h2><p>Like I said, the part of me that is competing with you for work wants you to continue producing crap.  It makes it SO much easier for me to land my next gig.  And now that I know, it has actually shaped what my resume looks like.  Two pages.  Just the essentials.  Links to places where they can get more information about me if they want to go that deep.</p>

        <p>The question comes up all the time, “How do I access JavaScript privates from my Unit Tests?”  And invariably, the purist chimes in with the answer, “you don’t”. But, isn’t the point of unit testing to allow us to test UNITs?  Why artificially limit our ability to test units if we don’t need to?  If we had the ability to create protected members, wouldn’t we tests those separately? So, what follows is how I surface my private JavaScript members so I can access them during tests without having to make them public during the run of my protection code. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/image-2.png" alt="Exposing Secret JavaScript privates to Unit Tests" title="Exposing Secret JavaScript privates to Unit Tests"> </p>
<h2 id="Lean-on-JavaScript"><a href="#Lean-on-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Lean on JavaScript"></a>Lean on JavaScript</h2><p>My JavaScript unit testing framework of choice is Jasmine.  Not so much because it does all I would like it to do or because there isn’t something ‘better’ available but because it has become the defacto standard for unit testing JavaScript and nothing else I’ve seen is significantly better.  There is one part of this technique that is going to lean on the fact that I am using Jasmine, but I’m sure you can adapt it to your testing framework. But first, let’s review how you would create private JavaScript members in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-Private-Members"><a href="#Creating-Private-Members" class="headerlink" title="Creating Private Members"></a>Creating Private Members</h2><p>In standard ES5 code, a simple object might be defined using syntax that looks something like this.  Recognize there are multiple ways to create objects and things that look like classes in JavaScript.  What follows is just enough code to get the point across. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-basicobjectwithprivates-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-basicobjectwithprivates-js</a> Note that our privateMember is used by publicMember but is not accessible from the outside.  I’m also using apply(this) to pass the context to the privateMember function.  This may not be necessary if you aren’t using this in the privateMember function and you could use privateMember.bind(this) to make this automatic.  That’s one of the interesting things about JavaScript.  There are always multiple ways to achieve the same goal.  None of them particularly better than the other but some more standard than the other. Notice that the only thing that actually makes our publicMember public is that I’ve attached the function pointer to this.</p>
<h2 id="Exposing-Private-for-Jasmine"><a href="#Exposing-Private-for-Jasmine" class="headerlink" title="Exposing Private for Jasmine"></a>Exposing Private for Jasmine</h2><p>The easiest way I know of to expose the private member variables for Jasmine is to conditionally assign the private members to this if jasmine is defined. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-exposeprivates-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-exposeprivates-js</a> As long as you don’t use the jasmine global variable for something other than jasmine, this should work. And now you can test your private functions.</p>
<h2 id="What-about-Spys"><a href="#What-about-Spys" class="headerlink" title="What about Spys?"></a>What about Spys?</h2><p>If you are testing your private functions on their own, you’ll probably have a need to place spys on them when you test the other functions in your application that call them.  This is where things get just a bit interesting. If we leave things as they are, and you place a spy on the function that we exposed, your spy will never get called.  The reason for this is because of the way pointers work. In our example above, our publicMember() function is going to call our privateMember() function regardless of how we manipulate the this.privateMember pointer.  This is because, while the variables are pointing to the same function, they are still two different variables and, because of the way spys work internally, you’ll end up changing the this.privateMember variable without impacting the call to privateMember(). We need to write a little extra code in our if(jasmine) block to make sure that after we’ve exposed privateMember(), the now public version of privateMember() gets call by publicMember() instead of the private version of privateMember(). To do this we are going to need to play “towers of hanoi” with our variables. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-towersofhanoi-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-towersofhanoi-js</a> The gist of what this new code does is that it captures the pointer to the privateMember() into oldPrivateMember.  Once we have that, we can make this.privateMember point to the original privateMember and then make our original privateMember point to a new method that calls this.privateMember, which is what our spy will call if we’ve set one up. The if(oldPrivateMember) stuff is just protection code to make sure we don’t do this more times than we need and end up calling this.privateMember up the call stack multiple times until we finally get to the privateMember function we ultimately want to call.  Depending on how you implement classes, you may or may not need this code.</p>

        <p>You see variations of the question, “Why does JavaScript loop only use the last value?” on StackOverflow all the time.  At work, the guy that sits next to me just ran into the same issue.  And the answer to the question requires a solid understanding of closures and <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/javascript-scope/">variable scope</a>.  Something I’ve <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/javascript-scope/">written about in the past</a>.  But, when I went back and looked at that article, I was surprised that I had not covered this particular very common topic. So, here is the basic scenario.  You have some sort of for/next loop that then calls some asynchronous function.  When the function runs, what you see when the code runs is that the last value of the loop index is the value that gets used in the function for every instance that it gets called. [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/image-1.png" alt="Why does JavaScript loop only use last value?" title="Why does JavaScript loop only use last value?"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/57855544@N00/340654162/">col_adamson</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">Visualhunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="An-Example"><a href="#An-Example" class="headerlink" title="An Example"></a>An Example</h2><p>Here is a really simple example that demonstrates the problem. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-js</a> But, you will also see it when you try to fire an event. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-event-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-event-js</a> Or even more common, when you try to make an AJAX call. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-ajax-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-ajax-js</a> For the remainder of this post, we’ll stick with the first example because the problem is the same and the code for that one has the least moving parts.</p>
<h2 id="The-Diagnosis"><a href="#The-Diagnosis" class="headerlink" title="The Diagnosis"></a>The Diagnosis</h2><p>The solution to the problem starts with understanding how JavaScript works.  In particular how closures work.  What happens when you use a variable that is declared outside the scope the variable is going to be used in, is that it will use the value that variable has at the time it runs.  It doesn’t get a copy of the value at the time the closure is setup.  If you think of closures as pointers rather than values, maybe that will help. So, in our working example, when the code actually runs, 10 will get spit out to the console 10 times because by the time the code runs, that is the value that i will have.  Maybe you thought it would be 9.  But the loop stopped looping because i was 10. If you think, “OK, so I’ll just make the function fire immediately after I set it up by using setTimeout(func,1), let me remind you that in our second example of firing an event, that is essentially what is happening there.  It won’t work either.</p>
<h2 id="Not-a-Matter-of-Timing"><a href="#Not-a-Matter-of-Timing" class="headerlink" title="Not a Matter of Timing"></a>Not a Matter of Timing</h2><p>JavaScript has, and probably always will be single threaded.  I say, probably always will be because way too much is relying on the single threaded nature of JavaScript at this point for it to safely change.  If you want to break the web, suddenly change that. So, even if we could set a timeout value small enough to execute before the loop will complete, what you have to remember about setTimeout and setInterval is that all we are doing when we make those calls is we are saying, “run this code as soon after the timeout value as possible.”  Under the hood it puts the function in the event queue when the timeout value has expired. Since JavaScript is single threaded, none of this will happen until the code we are currently executing has completed.</p>
<h2 id="Solution-1"><a href="#Solution-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1"></a>Solution 1</h2><p>One solution is to wrap our code in another closure that will run immediately. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-sol1-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-sol1-js</a> This example is using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) so that the function runs right away.  The effect is the same as the original code except for now the variable ii is local to our IIFE so it will not change every time the variable i changes.</p>
<h2 id="Solution-2"><a href="#Solution-2" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2"></a>Solution 2</h2><p>Now, by this point, you might be thinking, why not just create a new variable ii inside the loop? <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-sol2-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-sol2-js</a> Well, the problem with this is variable hoisting.  Any variable you declare within a function, regardless of where it is declared, is physically declared at the top of the function.  So, you aren’t really creating a variable local to the loop.  You are creating a variable local to the function (or global scope in this case) and you end up with the same problem as before. But, ES2015 recognizes and has finally provided a means of creating a variable local to a code block rather than just function blocks.  To do this, they’ve introduced the LET keyword. So, if you change your code to: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-sol2b-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-sol2b-js</a> The problem of course is that there aren’t a lot of browsers that support the LET keyword right now.  But there are transpilers that will convert your code from ES2015 to ES5.  And the way they do this is our final solution.</p>
<h2 id="Solution-3"><a href="#Solution-3" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3"></a>Solution 3</h2><p>The problem with solution 1 is that while it works most of the time, it really isn’t the most reliable way of solving the problem.  At the very least it sets up a lot more code that we really need.  If we peek under the hood to how the transpilers implement LET, what we see is that they take advantage of the fact that the CATCH block of the try/catch syntax has its own scope. So, all we have to do is throw i, catch it in the catch block and use the variable we caught in our callback function. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-sol3-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/79dcd8c1fa905d1720dd0798ba6fac18#file-whydoesjavascriptlooponlyuselastvalue-sol3-js</a> It tends to be a bit cleaner than solution 1 and is the solution I prefer.  But, there is another strong reason for using this last solution that most people overlook.  When you wrap a function with an IIFE like we’ve done with solution 1, it changes the meaning inside the IIFE of <code>this</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>.  Using the <code>try/catch</code> mechanism allows you to treat the code as if it were inline with the code the <code>try/catch</code> is in.  This is probably closer to what you had in mind when you wrote the original code to begin with.</p>

        <p>I’ve written about <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/category/agile/">Agile</a> and <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/tag/scrum/">Scrum</a> before and most of my regular readers know that I am a huge fan.  But recently I am starting to believe the Agile movement is doomed.  In fact, the most common response to my enthusiasm for Agile and Scrum is, “Yeah, we tried that once and it was a complete failure.”  Which seems odd to me because in every instance where I’ve been able to implement it, it has worked beautifully.  So why would I say Agile Will Not Succeed? The buzz around Agile has become so loud that Agile has moved from strictly a software development thing, to all corners of the business world.  And yet, as much as I believe Agile is the right way to develop software, as a movement, it is doomed for failure.  Why?

<h2 id="Reminder-Agile-Isn’t-a-Method"><a href="#Reminder-Agile-Isn’t-a-Method" class="headerlink" title="Reminder - Agile Isn’t a Method"></a>Reminder - Agile Isn’t a Method</h2><p>This is the surest sign that a movement is struggling.  It has become so popular that people are using it without knowing anything of what they are doing.  The surest sign you’ve walked into an organization where Agile is doomed is if they say something along the lines of “We do Agile.” Why is this a clear sign?  Because you can’t DO Agile.  You can only BE Agile.  <a href="//www.agilemanifesto.org/">Read the Agile Manifesto</a>.  There is nothing there about how to implement Agile.  It simply isn’t a methodology.  So, when an organization says to me they are “Doing Agile” it tells me right away that they have no idea what it means to be Agile.</p>
<h2 id="‘Doing-Agile’-for-the-Wrong-Reasons"><a href="#‘Doing-Agile’-for-the-Wrong-Reasons" class="headerlink" title="‘Doing Agile’ for the Wrong Reasons"></a>‘Doing Agile’ for the Wrong Reasons</h2><p>One of the outcomes of implementing an Agile process is that code tends to get developed faster.  Unfortunately, this has become the main selling point of moving toward Agile.  I get it, every shop I’ve worked in has been under some sort of development pressure to get stuff done.  So it is easy to look at faster delivery as the main reason why you would use an Agile method.  But, speed is a side effect.  In fact, it is only a long term side effect.  Initially, as you move toward being Agile, you will probably end up being slower.  You might have to lay people off because they only know how to work on their own while true Agile requires teamwork.  The more mature your team, the harder it will be to switch. So, if you shouldn’t move toward Agile because of speed, why should you? Well, two of the main reasons for me are: visibility, flexibility, and predictability. I was once told the story of how plumbers plumb a new house.  The first day they come in and hang all of the pipes in hangers.  By the time the owner comes by that evening, everything is hung and it looks like they are practically done.  They now have two weeks to get it all soldered together before the owner comes by again. This is why most Agile methods require short sprints.  The more you can show the customer the progress you are making, the less nervous they will get and the more likely you are to be left alone to do your job.  However, it will take time because the customer has been burned too often in the past, so it may be a while before they learn to wait for the sprint reviews. But there is an added advantage to being visible that is a huge win for everyone.  By letting the customer see the progress you are making, he is able to make tweaks along the way.  I’ve learned over the years that no one really knows what they want until they see it.  But letting them see it often and make tweaks along the way saves me from having to do a complete rewrite when I am “done.” And agile adds predictability that isn’t available using older methods.  It doesn’t let you say up front how long a project will take.  Estimates are still rather futile.  You’ll never know less about a project than the first day you try to provide an estimate.  But, as you progress, you will know roughly how much effort the remaining project will take and how much time that much effort will take on average.  The project becomes predictable using statistics generated by the project.</p>
<h2 id="You-Aren’t-Fully-Committed"><a href="#You-Aren’t-Fully-Committed" class="headerlink" title="You Aren’t Fully Committed"></a>You Aren’t Fully Committed</h2><p>In my last interview, I was asked if I had any experience with “Agile.”  I really need to learn to qualify that question.  I answered, “<a href="//www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/dbush2">I have my Scrum Master certification</a>, but I’ve yet to work in a truly Agile environment.”  And yet, I have worked in environments that call themselves “Agile”  But these are all environments that Carl and Richard over at <a href="//dotnetrocks.com/">DotNetRocks</a> call “Scrum But…”.  “Agile But…”?  And at another place, we called it “Scrummerfall”.  The idea is the same, rather than doing either Scrum or Kanban, they take the parts they’ve heard about that they like and merge them into what they are currently doing. Of course, they weren’t fully committed to the process they were using either, so it shouldn’t work any worse.  But it often does. One of the most obvious points of failure is with project management.  I’ve seen it all.  Scrum masters who are still trying to function as project managers and organizations that have skipped the scrum master role and left the project managers.  Stand ups that last an hour. Or how about this one.  Teams trying to estimate stories instead of task. I went on one interview that had the following bullets in the job request I was sent:</p>

<li>Must be able to work in an Agile environment</li>
</ul>
<p>followed three points later by</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be able to work under tight deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk about an oxymoron! When I asked what “Agile” meant to him (the owner of the company) he said, “Oh, that just means we do iterative development.” Here’s the deal.  If you are going to say you are going to implement Agile, at least learn enough about it to know what the word means!  You might decide it isn’t for you.  That’s fine.  Doing something simply because it is the “In” thing to do is never a good reason to do something.</p>
<h2 id="Management-Has-No-Clue"><a href="#Management-Has-No-Clue" class="headerlink" title="Management Has No Clue"></a>Management Has No Clue</h2><p>In my current job, I was told that some boss several levels up who I’ve still not met has declared our project to be a “Waterfall project” because “we already know what this is supposed to do.” As soon as I heard that, I said, “Someone doesn’t know what Agile is.” Here is why this sounds right.  The project I am working on is a rewrite from a very old platform to a web application.  In principle, from that definition, it sounds like a known entity.  However, simply because the GUI has changed there are things that were done on the old platform that make no sense on the new platform. But it gets worse.  The application is being expanded to include other business units with additional requirements.  So, we only partially know all this is supposed to do. If we were using true Waterfall, we would have to design the whole thing up front.  This project is due in a little less than a year.  Tell me what on the web doesn’t change in a year?</p>
<h2 id="Agile-Will-Not-Succeed"><a href="#Agile-Will-Not-Succeed" class="headerlink" title="Agile Will Not Succeed"></a>Agile Will Not Succeed</h2><p>So, what’s the point?  People love their perceptions.  Not reality.  What Agile set out to do was nobel, and for the most part, right.  But people are lazy.  They get a snippet of the truth here, a snippet of the truth there, ignore a snippet, paste in a snippet (here a snippet, there a snippet, everywhere a snip of snippet).  And that becomes their truth, while not being THE truth.  We do it with everything we believe.  Agile has reached that point of group think that it can now be classified as “religion.”  It now has so much group think weight that I’m not sure even those who started the movement can clearly articulate what it IS anymore.</p>
