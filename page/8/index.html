        <p>I’ve written about <a href="/tags/selenium/">using Selenium to test web applications before</a>.  But all of those articles have assumed you are using C#.  I’ve realized that Selenium has multiple language bindings which allow me to use any language I want but C# just seemed easier at the time.  But, now I’m in an environment that doesn’t use .NET at all.  They use Java.  I know Java, but I choose not to use it and instead my focus at this shop is all JavaScript.  Which means, if I want to write Selenium tests to verify my work, I need to write my tests in JavaScript.  But Using JavaScript to Drive Selenium is, in my opinion what everyone should be doing.  At least everyone who is writing most of their web application using client side code. Think about it, the primary language you wrote the client side with is JavaScript, and yet you are going to write your tests using C#, Java, PHP… when you could be writing the tests using JavaScript.  The same language you used to write the bulk of your application.  Further, when you write your tests using C# or Java, you’ll probably either write the tests using a unit testing framework (MSTest, NUnit, JUnit) or you’ll use some sort of BDD adapter like SpecFlow to coerce the unit testing framework into the behavioral pattern you need. <img src="/uploads/2016/08/image.png" alt="image" title="image">  If, you use JavaScript, you can use Jasmine, which is already behavioral, to run your tests. Another added advantage to the binding I’m going to recommend in this post, is that you get parallelization right out of the box.  You don’t need to write any funky code to <a href="/running-selenium-in-parallel-with-any-net-unit-testing-tool/">make your tests run in parallel</a>.  You get that for free. Another advantage I see for large companies is that not every group is going to be using the same server side language.  Where I’m at there are several groups using .NET and several groups using Java.  But everyone is using JavaScript.  If we all use JavaScript to drive our Selenium tests, we can share the knowledge we learn with other groups. So, let’s get started. For the purposes of this article, I’m going to assume you’ve already <a href="/you-can-start-using-node-today/">setup your node environment using the instructions I provided a couple of weeks ago</a>.  If you haven’t, you should do that now.  If you already have Node setup on your computer, but you are still using a version less that 6.3, I’m going to suggest you upgrade to the current version so that you can use some of the new ES2015 functionality like fat arrows.</p>
<h2 id="Setup"><a href="#Setup" class="headerlink" title="Setup"></a>Setup</h2><p>The tools we are going to use for testing using JavaScript, other than Node are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//webdriver.io/">WebDriver.io</a></li>
<li><a href="//webdriver.io/guide/reporters/spec.html">WebDriver.io Spec Reporter</a></li>
<li><a href="//jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And while the documentation on the WebDriver.IO site is quite complete, you would need to wade through quite a bit of information you don’t need to get this all setup and going.  We are going to give you just enough to get started.  If you want more information, I invite you to visit the website I’ve linked to above. For the purposes of this walk through, we are going to ignore the Selenium Grid part.  I’ve written about setting up Selenium Grid before.  Using the grid from WebDriver.io will just be a matter of changing some configurations.  Similarly, if you want to run the test from a cloud provider, the docs for that are on the website. Here, we are just going to get setup with a standalone server.  This suits my typical use of Selenium is to write a test for one specific tests at a time.  Once I have it working, I disable the tests.  The only time I run all of my test is prior to deploying the code to DEV just to make sure I didn’t break anything along the way.  Besides, setting up a standalone environment gets you started quickly. Before we really get started with the JavaScript stuff, make sure you have Java installed on your computer.  You’ll need that to run the Selenium stuff. So, to start out, install WebDriver.io First create a project directory for your new test project.  You can, of course, name it whatever you want.  Just make sure you make that directory your current working directory (CD into it.) Once you’re in the project directory, create your package.json file by typing in npm init Which will ask you several questions about your project.  Answer the questions and/or accept the defaults. Then install WebDriver.io by using the NPM command <code>npm install webdriverio --save-dev</code> This should place wdio in your ./node_modules/.bin directory.  Run <code>./node_modules/.bin/wdio --help</code> To verify that it is working.  If you are running on a Windows computer, you’ll want to make those forward slashes back slashes. Now that it is working, we are going to use it to configure a test runner file.  Type in ./node_module/.bin/wdio config One of the questions it is going to ask is which framework you want to use.  Pick ‘Jasmine’ Then it will ask if it should install the framework for you, pick ‘Yes’ Then it will ask where your tests are located.  Type in the correct location. Then it will ask which adapter you want to use.  Pick ‘spec’ and have it install that library for you. For Service, select ‘selenium-standalone’ and let it install that for you as well.  (Noticing a theme here?) For base URL, pick <a href="//www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a> because we are going to write out demo tests against google. Now sit back and let the wdio config install the missing parts it needs for your tests. By default, this setup makes FireFox the test browser.  You can change that using the instructions located here: <a href="//webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/configurationfile.html" title="http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/configurationfile.html">http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/configurationfile.html</a> I know that looks like a lot of setup, but it really is pretty easy.  One NPM command to install webdriver.io and another wdio command to get the config file setup and the rest of the dependencies installed.  Pretty sweet. Now, let’s write our first test.</p>
<h2 id="Writing-Tests"><a href="#Writing-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Writing Tests"></a>Writing Tests</h2><p>We are going to put our test in the directory we specified in our config file.  In my case, I put my tests under /tests/*<em>/</em>.js Just to make sure everything is working correctly, we are going to write a pretty simple first test. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-firsttest-spec-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-firsttest-spec-js</a> There are some bits that might look new here. First, because we are running this in node, only the file has scope so we can place ‘use strict’; at the top. Second, we are making use of the fat arrow functions.  For our purposes today, ()=&gt;{} is the same as function(){}.  Just a bit easier to write. Third, we are using a browser variable that hasn’t been defined anywhere.  At least not that we can see.  This is a design decision the WebDriverIO team made that I don’t necessarily agree with.  We should require() it into our module when we need it.  But it is what it is. You can checkout the API for the browser object here: <a href="//webdriver.io/api.html" title="http://webdriver.io/api.html">http://webdriver.io/api.html</a> So, our test is loading the default URL and checking the contents of the title tag. Now we run our test with wdio <code>./node_modules/.bin/wdio wdio.conf.js</code> Our test should pass.</p>
<h2 id="Page-Objects"><a href="#Page-Objects" class="headerlink" title="Page Objects"></a>Page Objects</h2><p>So that’s the basics. If you are already familiar with writing Selenium testing, that’s the guts of what you need to know to get going. If you aren’t, or you’ve never heard of Page Objects, that is what I plan to cover next. Generally, when we write our selenium test, we want to use a Page Object.  That is, we want to hide all of our Selenium specific stuff under an object so we can write our test without having to worry about the location of the elements on the screen changing. You see, here’s the problem you are going to run into.  You are going to write lots of tests.  At least I hope you do.  And then someday, you are going to want to change an ID of an element, or otherwise change how you find it.  If you write all of the tests so that they code directly to the Selenium code, you’ll need to find every place you were looking for that element and replace it with the new lookup.  Not very DRY. But, if you create a page object, you’ll put your code there and call it from your tests. So for an example.  Let’s create a GooglePage definition.  Once again, because we are using Node 6.3 (or above) we can use the class keyword.  The browser variable is still available to us because it is global. So, a pretty simple page object for Google search might look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-googlepage-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-googlepage-js</a> And then to access it from our test, we modify the test file above to look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-firsttest-spec2-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-firsttest-spec2-js</a> This is a pretty simple example for demonstration purposes.  If you’ve never done any kind of Selenium testing before, I recommend you dig a little deeper than where I’ve gone here</p>

        <p>We’ll get to Reasons Projects Succeed soon, but I need to do some setup work first. I’ve been thinking about starting an Open Source project for a while.  The only issue was; I didn’t have an idea for a project that didn’t already exist.  Now I do.  So, I’ve begun the process. The issue with starting a project like this is that I would much rather just start coding.  In fact, I would much rather not even make this Open Source.  But making it Open Source has forced me to face project management issues head on. I’ve been listening to enough podcast recently to know that putting something up on GitHub isn’t going to make a project Open Source any more than it will make it successful.  Therefor, I’ve decided to start the project as though it had a team of people already working on it.  It is a team of one for now.  But, one thing I’ve learned in life is that having the structure in place to handle a larger team now will not just benefit me in the future, but it will actually help my small little team of me today. I’ve started looking at other successful Open Source projects to see what they are doing and to determine what components of what they are doing I want to include in my project.  As I’ve gone through this exercise, the thought occurred to me, “If the organizations I’ve worked for implemented half of what these projects implement, the projects would have been run so much more efficiently and the projects that were in trouble may have avoided the trouble.” <figure><img src="/uploads/2016/07/image-5.png" alt="" title="10 Reasons Projects Succeed"><figcaption>Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/vuhung/8576985602/">Nguyen Vu Hung (vuhung)</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">Visual Hunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></figcaption></figure></p>

        <p>I was just getting started writing an article about using Node/JavaScript to drive my Selenium tests and as I was writing the “Prerequisite” section, I realized I have never written the basics about how to get setup with Node or even why you would want to. As popular as Node is, I am still finding that many of the people I work with have no idea what it is or if they do, they only have a partial idea and can’t see how it would apply to the work they do on a daily basis. So, let’s start with the fundamentals. <figure><img src="/uploads/2016/07/image-4.png" alt="" title="You Can Start Using Node Today"><figcaption>Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/stevendepolo/5749192025/">stevendepolo</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></figcaption></figure></p>

        <p>The MVVM design pattern has been around for quite a while now.  It has a lot of strengths when done correctly. But, I believe the time has come to recognize that MVVM has a lot of shortcomings that point to its demise.  Since I primarily develop web applications, I will keep this discussion centered on the use of MVVM in web applications.  The use of MVVM for desktop may or may not have these same issues. I realize that for some of you, the very suggestion of dropping MVVM will invoke a negative emotional response.  Some very smart people have quit their job at the suggestion that MVVM and its close cousin two-way data-binding, be abandoned in favor of another way.  But just for a few minutes, I would like for you to stop treating programming as a religion and consider the possibility that there may be a better way. <img src="/uploads/2016/07/image-2.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="History-of-MVVM"><a href="#History-of-MVVM" class="headerlink" title="History of MVVM"></a>History of MVVM</h2><p>MVVM was originally created by John Gossman to support the XAML syntax used to create Windows™ desktop applications and Silver Light applications.  Its main advantage has always been that it provides an easy way to decouple the View code from any business logic that might need to run.  Because of this decoupling, our applications become much easier to unit test. The next major implementation of MVVM that I can remember is <a href="//knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>.  It is the knockout framework that introduced me to MVVM and I have to say it is also the only one I feel like actually got it right.  By that I mean that it actually did what it was advertised to do.  Maybe that’s because of all the implementations I’ve used, Knockout is the only one that ONLY implemented MVVM rather than making it part of a larger framework.</p>
<h2 id="Definition-of-MVVM"><a href="#Definition-of-MVVM" class="headerlink" title="Definition of MVVM"></a>Definition of MVVM</h2><p>I’ve written about MVVM before where I’ve explained more completely what MVVM is.  But just so we have a working definition of what I mean when I talk about MVVM, let’s define it this way. MVVM is a design pattern that uses two-way data-binding to get data in and out of the presentation layer, referred to as the View, without the programmer needing to do any more than specifying that this should happen in the view.  MVVM is also able to have data elements and functions in the “ViewModel” track changes so that anything that is dependent on other data is automatically recalculated without the programmer having to write a lot of code to make this happen.  This creates a model that is able to respond to events in the view, but is primarily data centric rather than event centric has we have often reasoned about our applications in the past. It sounds great.  And when it works it is.  But that’s the main problem, it hardly ever works well.</p>
<h2 id="MVVM-Done-Right-is-Slow"><a href="#MVVM-Done-Right-is-Slow" class="headerlink" title="MVVM Done Right is Slow"></a>MVVM Done Right is Slow</h2><p>If you’ve had any experience or paid any attention to the implementation of MVVM using JavaScript, you will realize that the number one problem with MVVM is that it is a memory hog and performs poorly for all but the most trivial of applications.  In fact, for all of the popularity of Angular JS, the biggest complaint has been around the implementation of the data-binding.  In a large application, you might need to loop through the data multiple times to make sure it has all recalculated correctly.  If you just use the framework and let the framework deal with your sloppy code, this can make the system incredibly slow.  If you actually pay attention to what you are doing, it takes longer to implement than if you had chosen some other design pattern. But doing that means we have not moved on to…</p>
<h2 id="MVVM-is-Hard-to-Implement"><a href="#MVVM-is-Hard-to-Implement" class="headerlink" title="MVVM is Hard to Implement"></a>MVVM is Hard to Implement</h2><p>Recognizing that looping through the data until it stabilizes may not be a good idea, the framework designers have developed rules such as, “We’ll only run the digest cycle once.”  and “We’ll only run it when some user interaction has occurred.”  Well, OK.  That sounds good.  At least now it will be obvious that I have a problem.  But this is where the trouble begins.  If I can’t rely on my data, and ultimately my view, responding to changes in my data correctly, I am left with having to only partially implementing MVVM so that I can work around these limitations and using other means to make sure my view is updated correctly. This is to say nothing of many frameworks just not working as you would expect them to.</p>
<h2 id="MVVM-is-Hard-to-Reason-About"><a href="#MVVM-is-Hard-to-Reason-About" class="headerlink" title="MVVM is Hard to Reason About"></a>MVVM is Hard to Reason About</h2><p>Again, in all but the most trivial of applications, and because of the optimizations that various frameworks have tried to implement, MVVM becomes difficult to implement.  As I’ve tried to explain MVVM to others and even as I’ve tried to implement it myself, I’ve found that the simple act of keeping the view stuff in the view layer and the data stuff in the data layer and making sure it all updates appropriately has me, at times tearing my hair out.  Many times this is caused by incomplete implementations.  But if being hard to implement means it is hard to reason about, maybe we shouldn’t be using it to begin with.</p>
<h2 id="MVVM-is-Overkill"><a href="#MVVM-is-Overkill" class="headerlink" title="MVVM is Overkill"></a>MVVM is Overkill</h2><p>But it does work sometimes.  In really simple CRUD applications, it works great.  None of the problems I’ve mentioned.  And this is the great seduction of MVVM.  You try it on some small application and you get excited.  Like a gateway drug, it lures you in.  And when you finally go to implement it on some larger application, you find out that it really doesn’t scale all that well.  And on that small app you tried it on, couldn’t you have done that just as easily using another design pattern?</p>
<h2 id="Where-to-Go-from-Here"><a href="#Where-to-Go-from-Here" class="headerlink" title="Where to Go from Here"></a>Where to Go from Here</h2><p>As I was reviewing these arguments with a co-worker this week, he asked, “Are you saying we shouldn’t be using MVVM?”  And my answer might surprise you. I said, “Given the two models we have to work within the framework we are currently using, MVVM is the best choice.” However, what we might want to consider is moving to another framework that provides a better design pattern.  There are several “One-way” design patterns that intrigue me.  The first is the basic Flux pattern that React tends to use.  Done correctly, this uses events to achieve the decoupling we all should be striving for.  At its core, it is basic MVC. The second one, which is very flux like, is RxJS.  I’m still wrapping my head around how I to use it in an application and honestly don’t know enough about it at this point to say any more than that it looks interesting. And even if we decided to move away from MVVM, I think using two way data-binding between the view and the ViewModel is good.  I just think the ViewModel shouldn’t try to re-compute the values as part of what it does. Leave that to the developer to control.  The problem is, trying to get existing systems that implement two-way data-binding to only work at that level would not work correctly.  </p>

        <p>Coding Katas are a way of developing your skills as a programmer.  I thought it might be informative to tackle one of the classics as a blog post. Depending on how this works, I may or may not do another one quite so publicly. The rules I’m going to try to adhere by.</p>
<ol>
<li>I will document what I am doing as I go.</li>
<li>This is not a pre-coded blog post.  You’ll get to “see” me code as I go.</li>
<li>I will write all tests first.</li>
<li><p>I will only write enough code to make the current tests succeed.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2016/07/image-3.png" alt="Test Driven Kata - Roman to Arabic" title="Test Driven Kata - Roman to Arabic"> </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Today’s-problem"><a href="#Today’s-problem" class="headerlink" title="Today’s problem:"></a>Today’s problem:</h2><p>This is a pretty classic coding problem that shows up in interviews, home-work assignments, and code katas. As an interview problem, I find it lacking because it typically does not represent the kind of work you will be doing other than proving that you can solve problems in your chosen language.  It is also a standard coding problem, meaning the person interviewing you is using the most obvious problem to see if you can code.  Much like asking “What is your greatest strength?” and “What is your greatest weakness?”  Finally, it takes longer to complete than I believe interview coding problems should.  This is not to say, I don’t jump through these hoops myself. As a kata exercise, it is good because there are several ways you might solve the problem.  And for our purposes, it also demonstrates what Test Driven Development might look like using JavaScript. So, what is the problem? Write a function that converts Roman numbers into Arabic numbers and throws an error if the Roman number is in an invalid form. That sounds pretty easy.  But the first question we need to ask is, “What, exactly are the rules for converting Roman numbers into Arabic numbers?”</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The values for Roman numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>Roman</p>
<p>Arabic</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>L</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>D</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>100</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeating a number up to three times adds that value three times.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Roman ‘digit’ can’t repeat more than three times.  Instead the previous 1, 10, or 100 equivalent value is used to subtract from the next ‘digit’.  That is,</p>
<p>Roman</p>
<p>Arabic</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>IX</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>XL</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>XC</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>CD</p>
<p>400</p>
<p>CM</p>
<p>900</p>
</li>
<li><p>With the exception of the subtraction rule above, all values must decrease in scale from left to right and are added together.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Test-1"><a href="#Test-1" class="headerlink" title="Test 1"></a>Test 1</h2><p>Since we will be using JavaScript, the testing framework we will be using is Jasmine. Our first test will simply test that when we pass in “I” we get back 1. Since there is no way of embedding GitHub repository files into WordPress that I know of, and I’m too lazy to create a gist for each step along the way, I’ll just provide links to the source at the various points along the way.  If you know of a way to directly include the source files, let me know in the comments. So, here is the first link: <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the code that passes this test is here: <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-1/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a> You might think, what’s the point?  Why just return 1 when you know you are going to have to do more?  Well, when you are doing TDD, you have to work off of what you are testing for now, not what you might test for later.  So, we return 1.</p>
<h2 id="Test-2"><a href="#Test-2" class="headerlink" title="Test 2"></a>Test 2</h2><p>From here, we can go a couple of different directions.  How about testing for rule 3 next.  How would we do that? To start with, we might just make sure that if we pass in IV, we get back 4.  Now our code is getting a bit more complicated.  But sticking with our TDD principles, we’ll just test for IV.  Another happy path test. Here is the code that test for our two conditions: <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the code that implements it <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-2/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Test-3"><a href="#Test-3" class="headerlink" title="Test 3"></a>Test 3</h2><p>OK.  What happens if IV shows up twice?  That should be a failure.  IV should never show up more than once.  In fact, none of the codes that show up in rule three should show up more than once.  Let’s make sure they don’t. The tests for this will be pretty simple, and to save time, we will code for all of them at once.  In fact, we are going to eventually need the conversion tables above, so let’s go ahead and put them in now. Here is what our test file looks like now.  Notice that we’ve put several tests in at once. Notice that I didn’t have to write multiple tests to do this.  I just created one test and iterated over it. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the solution also iterates. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-3/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Test-4"><a href="#Test-4" class="headerlink" title="Test 4"></a>Test 4</h2><p>Just to make sure we aren’t counting how many times in a row this all shows up, let’s add a valid Roman Number in between. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-4/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-4/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-4/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> Look at that, it all still works!</p>
<h2 id="Test-5"><a href="#Test-5" class="headerlink" title="Test 5"></a>Test 5</h2><p>Next, we need to make sure that none of the items in our base table show up more than 3 times.  We’ll write a similar test to what we’ve already written with a twist.  If any of those numerals show up more than 4 times, we know we have a problem either because they are out of order or because they show up all in a row.  So, we only need to check the count.  If there are four of any of them, we have a problem. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the code to implement it. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-5/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Test-6"><a href="#Test-6" class="headerlink" title="Test 6"></a>Test 6</h2><p>So, before we move on to actually computing the value of the Roman number, we should ask ourselves if there are any other ways a Roman number could be passed in incorrectly. The next one that occurs to me is this.  If you have a number that contains a ‘digit’ from the minusOneTable, the character that is used to subtract should never follow the digit.  For example, if “IV” shows up, there shouldn’t not be an “I” immediately after it.  That is, we shouldn’t see “IVI” anywhere in our string.  So let’s add that to our tests. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the code to implement it <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-6/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-7"><a href="#Step-7" class="headerlink" title="Step 7"></a>Step 7</h2><p>There is one more possible problem we could encounter.  What if someone passes in a character that isn’t a valid Roman number character.  We need to make sure that the only characters that show up are Roman number characters. Since testing for all of the characters isn’t practical, we are just going to test for a few and assume that if this were a real business problem we’d go to the trouble of testing more.  But, the basic test is going to look the same.  Toss in bad characters in an otherwise valid string and make sure we throw an error. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the solution, which is pretty simple. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-7/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-8"><a href="#Step-8" class="headerlink" title="Step 8"></a>Step 8</h2><p>OK. I think that gets all of the validations except for ensuring that the numbers show up in numerical order.  To make this work, we are going to need to work through the array and assign each digit a value.  The test we need to write is going to put values in the wrong order. Our test will put the next value up after the value. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a> And the solution will put them in order and add them along the way. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-8/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-9"><a href="#Step-9" class="headerlink" title="Step 9"></a>Step 9</h2><p>And finally we add some test to verify that we get the right result. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-9/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-9/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-9/tests/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.spec.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Review"><a href="#Review" class="headerlink" title="Review"></a>Review</h2><p>What?! I thought we were done? Well, we are and we aren’t.  We have code that works.  But is it the best code we can write? Here is what I like about this code:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is easy to reason about.</li>
<li>It allows me to add additional roman numbers by expanding my tables.  No additional code would be needed. (And while it is hard to represent using Arabic letters, there are additional symbols.)</li>
<li>It works reasonably fast.</li>
</ol>
<p>But, it does seem to me that we might make it a bit more efficient without sacrificing these advantages too much.  And the great news is, since we have our test in place, we can refactor with impunity.  No worries about breaking something because we will know as soon as we have and we can revert back to the code that was working.</p>
<h2 id="Step-12"><a href="#Step-12" class="headerlink" title="Step 12"></a>Step 12</h2><p>One pretty simple change we can make is that our error message is scattered throughout our code.  Let’s make that a variable and just throw the variable. The other thing I wonder about is how much of our validations can be combined? One check we might safely eliminate at this point is the check to make sure the minus values only show up once.  If any of them were to show up more than once, they would either show up one after the other, which we still can check for, or they would be in the wrong value order which our final check will catch.  So, let’s eliminate that code as well and re-run our tests to make sure nothing broke. And now that we’ve eliminated that check, we can create one big string for checking conditions like “IVI” into one string and check it once instead of creating a new RegExp object multiple times. Here is the code we have so far: <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-10/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-10/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-10/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-11"><a href="#Step-11" class="headerlink" title="Step 11"></a>Step 11</h2><p>Now that we have our IVI check down to one string, it occurs to me that we can combine this check with our invalid character check.  So, let’s do that next. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-11/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-11/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-11/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-12-1"><a href="#Step-12-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 12"></a>Step 12</h2><p>And the last place we can optimize is our three digit check.  But instead of limiting it to valid Roman numbers, let’s just check for any sequence of characters that repeats 4 times or more. And once we know that is working, we can combine it with our other Regular Expressions. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-12/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-12/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-12/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-13"><a href="#Step-13" class="headerlink" title="Step 13"></a>Step 13</h2><p>We’ve cleaned up about all of the logic we can without hard coding the values.  But I would like to combine the lookup tables next.  I don’t like having three tables.  Let’s see if we can pull those into one table. The first step to doing this is combining the minusOneTable and baseTable into one table.  To differentiate in the code that is using those tables, we’ll just look at the length of the property. In the process of doing this, we notice that it would also make sense to combine the substitution table.  And since the values we’ve assigned to the table aren’t even being used at this point, we’ll just use the substitutions instead of the values. And if we make the value of each element in the baseTable an array, we could combine the values into that table as well.  But that would over complicate our lookup logic when we compute the value.  So, I think we’ll just leave that as it is. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-13/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-13/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-13/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Step-14"><a href="#Step-14" class="headerlink" title="Step 14"></a>Step 14</h2><p>Finally, I think we want to consolidate the loops into one loop. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-14/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas/blob/Step-14/katas/roman-to-arabic/romanToArabic.js</a></p>
<h2 id="Review-1"><a href="#Review-1" class="headerlink" title="Review"></a>Review</h2><p>There are probably a few other optimizations that could be made here.  But I’m afraid that each would sacrifice either the flexibility.  That is, we could hard code the regular expression validations, which would significantly reduce the number of lines of code.  Or we would sacrifice the readability.  Neither of which I am willing to do. If you are only interested in the result, you can find the finished project at. <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas" title="https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas">https://github.com/DaveMBush/JavaScriptKatas</a></p>

        <p>I’ve worked with Ext JS now for a total of 2.5 years.  First with Ext 4.2 and now with Ext 6.x. Here’s my experience, and warning, of why you should avoid this disaster of a framework. <img src="/uploads/2016/07/image-1.png" alt="7 Reasons To Evade Ext JS" title="7 Reasons To Evade Ext JS"> </p>
<h2 id="Jack-of-All-Trades"><a href="#Jack-of-All-Trades" class="headerlink" title="Jack of All Trades"></a>Jack of All Trades</h2><p>Master of none! One of the great selling points of using Ext JS is the fact that it comes with “Everything you need” to build a web application.  That would be great if it were true.  But the fact of the matter is, it comes with all of the features you need but the features are all only partially implemented.  I’ve complained publicly several times that Sencha can’t possibly be testing the code they release because it only works in their demos.  If you try to use a feature they have documented as being available, you are likely to find that the feature doesn’t actually work.  How is it possible that you’ve written documentation for how something is supposed to work and yet you can release it without it working properly?  I can understand fringe stuff getting by.  We can’t think of every test.  But when this happens over and over again, you start to wonder what exactly they are testing.</p>
<h2 id="A-Wolf-in-Sheep’s-Clothing"><a href="#A-Wolf-in-Sheep’s-Clothing" class="headerlink" title="A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing"></a>A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing</h2><p>When I first started with Ext, the only design pattern they had available was what they referred to as MVC.  It took me two months of playing with the framework before I finally realized that what they were calling MVC wasn’t anything the <a href="/designPatterns">Gang of Four</a> would recognize as MVC.  I guess if you have a View, a Model and a Controller, you can call it MVC?  It doesn’t matter that the Models define records in a table or that the Controller is tightly coupled to your view.</p>
<h2 id="Sheep-Without-Legs"><a href="#Sheep-Without-Legs" class="headerlink" title="Sheep Without Legs"></a>Sheep Without Legs</h2><p>OK.  So when they introduced the MVVM architecture I actually started to have just a bit of hope.  Yes, there were still some fundamental issues I have, but MVVM would make this tolerable.  But here is the issue.  Their idea of MVVM is that you would only need to implement it on a per page basis. Let me try to explain.</p>
<h3 id="Broken-Data-Binding"><a href="#Broken-Data-Binding" class="headerlink" title="Broken Data Binding"></a>Broken Data Binding</h3><p>In my ideal world, when I build a new component, I would build that component using the framework the rest of my application is using.  So my component uses MVVM.  Sencha’s implementation gives you a View, ViewController, and ViewModel.  Mostly this looks more like MVC if you ask me but whatever, it has two-way databinding, so we’ll call it MVVM for now.  If you build a component that lives inside another component, the first thing you’ll discover is that binding only works from the top down.  That is, I can bind data at the outer layer and it will get reflected all of the way in to the inner most component that uses it.  But, if you change the data in the inner most component, it doesn’t reflect back up to the outer most component.  I’ve written a hack for this, and there is no promise from Sencha that this will ever get fixed properly, so I guess my hack is safe.</p>
<h3 id="Broken-Controllers"><a href="#Broken-Controllers" class="headerlink" title="Broken Controllers"></a>Broken Controllers</h3><p>But it gets worse.  While child components can find data in models that are in parent components properly, they can’t find references to functions in controllers in the same way.  This is particularly problematic if you write a component that is a container of other components.  You would naturally want the child components to use the controller from the component that they were declared in.  But if you have an outer component that has your container component as a child and then other components inside of that.  The only way you can control what controller the child most components are going to notify of events is by wrapping the inner most components in their own component with their own controller.  This gets to be awkward when all you want to do is provide an event handler for one control in a column of a grid control.  Again, I have a monkey patch that fixes this, but why did I have to write it? This is just one specific example of my “Jack of All Trades” point that I started with. We won’t even address the question of if this is really MVVM or not!</p>
<h2 id="Never-Use-the-0-release"><a href="#Never-Use-the-0-release" class="headerlink" title="Never Use the .0 release"></a>Never Use the .0 release</h2><p>I think most of us now are generally conditioned to be wary of the .0 release of anything that hasn’t been developed using Open Source methods.  There just haven’t been enough eyes on the project to ensure that everything works as it should. But with Sencha, this extends to all of the patch releases at the very least and even into some minor releases. While the 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 releases were unacceptably broken, we find that every new patch or minor release that comes out afterward breaks something that was working.  We always have to ask, “Can we live with this?”</p>
<h2 id="All-or-Nothing"><a href="#All-or-Nothing" class="headerlink" title="All or Nothing"></a>All or Nothing</h2><p>As I said at the beginning, Sencha gives you everything.  That sounds good.  You won’t have to go looking for a grid control, or many other common controls you might want to use. But the bad news is, you can only use controls that were written to be used with Ext.  Which other than what Sencha provides in the framework, doesn’t give you a lot of choices.  Don’t go thinking you’ll supplement Ext with a selection of third party controls.  It’s not going to happen.</p>
<h2 id="Fences-Protect-AND-Isolate"><a href="#Fences-Protect-AND-Isolate" class="headerlink" title="Fences Protect AND Isolate"></a>Fences Protect AND Isolate</h2><p>Up until this point in my post, no one can reasonably argue that anything I’ve said is actually a benefit.  At this point we switch to points that may vary based on how well you know JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You see, the good news, and actually a major selling point to many people, is that you can write a web application using Ext without having to know much, if anything about HTML or CSS.  And for that matter even the amount of JavaScript you need to know is relatively limited. That’s the good news.  The bad news is, if you know anything about any of these, you’ll probably end up frustrated by EXT.  This is because Ext’s JavaScript controls most of the layout.  So if you are used to going into developer tools to tweak the CSS and then applying that to your style sheet, you are going to be very disappointed.  Pretty much nothing you do in developer tools is going to work as you would expect.  And figuring out how to apply those to your code is going to be a lot harder than you are used to.</p>
<h2 id="Their-Way-or-the-Highway"><a href="#Their-Way-or-the-Highway" class="headerlink" title="Their Way or the Highway"></a>Their Way or the Highway</h2><p>Once again, many people see this as an advantage.  And once again if you aren’t familiar with how the rest of the JavaScript world does things, this is going to sound fine.</p>
<h3 id="Sencha-CMD"><a href="#Sencha-CMD" class="headerlink" title="Sencha CMD"></a>Sencha CMD</h3><p>Everything runs through Sencha CMD.  A tool for building all things Ext.  If you want to bundle and minify your code, the standard way of doing this is by using “requires” statements in your code and then running Sencha CMD and have it figure out what you are using and put it all in one bundle. The problem with this is that there are several much better ways of doing this that are available using Node and various NPM packages.  Again, if you are a JavaScript developer, you are going to wonder what Sencha is thinking.</p>
<h3 id="Ext-define"><a href="#Ext-define" class="headerlink" title="Ext.define()"></a>Ext.define()</h3><p>Another place where proprietary shows up is in how Ext defines “Classes”.  When it was first introduced, TypeScript was new.  But now, we not only have TypeScript, which does much of what Ext does and some things it doesn’t, but we have an evolving JavaScript standard that I’m afraid Sencha won’t be able to keep up with.  They already discourage the use of ‘use strict’;.  Once again, there is only one place where this will get you in trouble, and the work around actually produces more efficient code.  But still, the point is, Sencha is relying on ECMA Script 3 standards while the world has largely moved on to ECMA 2015 and beyond. Anyhow, my point here is that Ext is not just a framework but also functions, largely, as its own language.  Not quite as much a fork from the standard as Coffee Script, but also not nearly as close to the JavaScript spec as TypeScript.  So while it is still JavaScript, if you are a JavaScript programmer, it isn’t going to feel quite like JavaScript to you.</p>
<h3 id="Themes"><a href="#Themes" class="headerlink" title="Themes"></a>Themes</h3><p>The final place you will find “Proprietary” lurking is with the Themes.  There are several really good CSS frameworks out there.  Sencha uses none of them.  And while the syntax they use for creating themes has been SASS up until Ext 6, now they even have their own proprietary SASS compiler.  Watch out here because they are still using the SASS extensions so you are likely to make some assumptions here that aren’t true because, once again, they’ve only implemented enough of the SASS engine to do what THEY need to do.</p>
<h2 id="VB-All-Over-Again"><a href="#VB-All-Over-Again" class="headerlink" title="VB All Over Again"></a>VB All Over Again</h2><p>Every time I hear someone praise how great Ext is, it is normally because it has everything you need out of the box and allows you to get stuff done quickly.  Basically the same argument for using Visual Basic back in the day.  And yet I learned to never take a VB job because it almost every instance, while it was possible to write well structured code in Visual Basic, it was generally so difficult to do that the code I would be maintaining would need to be rewritten in order to make any sense of it. Ext suffers the same issue.  There is nothing in Ext to force you to write well structured code.  The code I have had to maintain has almost always followed every anti-pattern known to man.  In this case, this isn’t Sencha’s fault directly other than the fact that the only reason my code tends to be cleaner than most is because I’m more likely to code a fix to an Ext bug than I am to work around the problem with an anti-pattern. In comparison to other frameworks that are available, if all you want is a tool that will get you a semi working application quickly, and you don’t care so much about having to rewrite it when you need to change it in some way, Ext is your tool.  If on the other hand, you care about design and you want to be able to maintain what you’ve written, you should look elsewhere. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>

        <p>Several weeks ago, I wrote about <a href="/why-does-javascript-loop-only-use-last-value/">how closures impact calling asynchronous functions</a> in a loop and several ways of dealing with that problem. In my recent coding, I’ve discovered an even more simple way of dealing with this problem. In the process, it removes the anonymous function and eliminates the linting error, ‘Don’t make functions within a loop’ You see, I’ve been experimenting with JavaScript <code>bind()</code>. And as it turns out, we can use bind in multiple situations, including dealing with the closure issue I mentioned a couple of weeks ago. <figure><img src="/uploads/2016/07/image.png" alt="" title="JavaScript bind() for cleaner code"><figcaption>Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/connortarter/4754231502/">Connor Tarter</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a></figcaption></figure></p>

        <p>Over the last several years, I’ve had a chance to read a few Programming Resumes.  Or, I should say, TRY to read a few resumes.  But frankly, if the Programming Resume I typically see is common, everyone who reads my blog needs this advice.  I haven’t seen a barely adequate resume in years.  And I’m sick of it.  Oh, it’s good for me of course.  I know my resume is going to stand out as such a unique work of art compared to the others, that I will get a call back right away.  After all, if the competition is so incredibly weak, I don’t even need to try. On the other hand, as someone who has to read these resumes, I’d like to have something better. And no, I’m not going to go over the standard “how to make your resume awesome” stuff because evidently most programmers can’t even get the basics down.

        <p>The question comes up all the time, “How do I access JavaScript privates from my Unit Tests?”  And invariably, the purist chimes in with the answer, “you don’t”. But, isn’t the point of unit testing to allow us to test UNITs?  Why artificially limit our ability to test units if we don’t need to?  If we had the ability to create protected members, wouldn’t we tests those separately? So, what follows is how I surface my private JavaScript members so I can access them during tests without having to make them public during the run of my protection code. <img src="/uploads/2016/06/image-2.png" alt="Exposing Secret JavaScript privates to Unit Tests" title="Exposing Secret JavaScript privates to Unit Tests"> </p>
<h2 id="Lean-on-JavaScript"><a href="#Lean-on-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Lean on JavaScript"></a>Lean on JavaScript</h2><p>My JavaScript unit testing framework of choice is Jasmine.  Not so much because it does all I would like it to do or because there isn’t something ‘better’ available but because it has become the defacto standard for unit testing JavaScript and nothing else I’ve seen is significantly better.  There is one part of this technique that is going to lean on the fact that I am using Jasmine, but I’m sure you can adapt it to your testing framework. But first, let’s review how you would create private JavaScript members in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-Private-Members"><a href="#Creating-Private-Members" class="headerlink" title="Creating Private Members"></a>Creating Private Members</h2><p>In standard ES5 code, a simple object might be defined using syntax that looks something like this.  Recognize there are multiple ways to create objects and things that look like classes in JavaScript.  What follows is just enough code to get the point across. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-basicobjectwithprivates-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-basicobjectwithprivates-js</a> Note that our privateMember is used by publicMember but is not accessible from the outside.  I’m also using apply(this) to pass the context to the privateMember function.  This may not be necessary if you aren’t using this in the privateMember function and you could use privateMember.bind(this) to make this automatic.  That’s one of the interesting things about JavaScript.  There are always multiple ways to achieve the same goal.  None of them particularly better than the other but some more standard than the other. Notice that the only thing that actually makes our publicMember public is that I’ve attached the function pointer to this.</p>
<h2 id="Exposing-Private-for-Jasmine"><a href="#Exposing-Private-for-Jasmine" class="headerlink" title="Exposing Private for Jasmine"></a>Exposing Private for Jasmine</h2><p>The easiest way I know of to expose the private member variables for Jasmine is to conditionally assign the private members to this if jasmine is defined. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-exposeprivates-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-exposeprivates-js</a> As long as you don’t use the jasmine global variable for something other than jasmine, this should work. And now you can test your private functions.</p>
<h2 id="What-about-Spys"><a href="#What-about-Spys" class="headerlink" title="What about Spys?"></a>What about Spys?</h2><p>If you are testing your private functions on their own, you’ll probably have a need to place spys on them when you test the other functions in your application that call them.  This is where things get just a bit interesting. If we leave things as they are, and you place a spy on the function that we exposed, your spy will never get called.  The reason for this is because of the way pointers work. In our example above, our publicMember() function is going to call our privateMember() function regardless of how we manipulate the this.privateMember pointer.  This is because, while the variables are pointing to the same function, they are still two different variables and, because of the way spys work internally, you’ll end up changing the this.privateMember variable without impacting the call to privateMember(). We need to write a little extra code in our if(jasmine) block to make sure that after we’ve exposed privateMember(), the now public version of privateMember() gets call by publicMember() instead of the private version of privateMember(). To do this we are going to need to play “towers of hanoi” with our variables. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-towersofhanoi-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/86f271faa70152675f0719d87a0268c4#file-towersofhanoi-js</a> The gist of what this new code does is that it captures the pointer to the privateMember() into oldPrivateMember.  Once we have that, we can make this.privateMember point to the original privateMember and then make our original privateMember point to a new method that calls this.privateMember, which is what our spy will call if we’ve set one up. The if(oldPrivateMember) stuff is just protection code to make sure we don’t do this more times than we need and end up calling this.privateMember up the call stack multiple times until we finally get to the privateMember function we ultimately want to call.  Depending on how you implement classes, you may or may not need this code.</p>

        <p>You see variations of the question, “Why does JavaScript loop only use the last value?” on StackOverflow all the time.  At work, the guy that sits next to me just ran into the same issue.  And the answer to the question requires a solid understanding of closures and <a href="/javascript-scope/">variable scope</a>.  Something I’ve <a href="/javascript-scope/">written about in the past</a>.  But, when I went back and looked at that article, I was surprised that I had not covered this particular very common topic. So, here is the basic scenario.  You have some sort of for/next loop that then calls some asynchronous function.  When the function runs, what you see when the code runs is that the last value of the loop index is the value that gets used in the function for every instance that it gets called. <figure><img src="/uploads/2016/06/image-1.png" alt="" title="Why does JavaScript loop only use last value?"><figcaption>Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/57855544@N00/340654162/">col_adamson</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">Visualhunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></figcaption></figure></p>
