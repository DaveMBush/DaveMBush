    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>One of the design principles in software development is to only write what you need today.  This has taken on the moniker of YAGNI (You Aren’t Going To Need It).</p>
<p>The question is, in what ways do we violate this principle?</p>
<h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features:"></a>Features:</h2><p>The most obvious situation where we tend to violate YAGNI is in feature creep.  We design in a new end user feature that seems really cool to us.  We may even try to sell the end user into believing they need the feature.  Maybe it is just eye candy.  “We can make this screen animate when it opens.”</p>
<p>Yeah, but is that a requirement or a nice to have?  How much longer will it take to design that?  How many more bugs will it introduce?</p>
<p>I think most of us get YAGNI at what I would call the “Visible Feature” level.  That is, what the end user will see immediately.</p>
<p>Where I think most of us get this wrong is at the code design and architecture level.</p>
<h2 id="Architecture"><a href="#Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Architecture:"></a>Architecture:</h2><h4 id="Do-you-have-a-tendency-to-over-architect-your-code"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-tendency-to-over-architect-your-code" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a tendency to over architect your code?"></a>Do you have a tendency to over architect your code?</h4><p>This is an impossible question to answer because I think all of us think we architect to just the right level.  So what are some signs that you have gone too far?</p>
<p>Well, one of them might be how you defend your decision to write your code in a particular way.  If your answer is anything remotely like, “We might need it to do…” you are probably over architecting.</p>
<p>For example, when you write your code, are you thinking about all of the ways it might be used in the future?  That business rule you are writing, it might be used as a web service, or need to be accessed by JSON.  You never know.</p>
<p>But really, unless you need it to do all of that stuff today, you are probably spending more time on the code you are writing than you need to.  Why?  Because most of the time all of those, “we might need it to…” never happen.  And when they do happen, they happen in entirely unexpected ways that you can not foresee.</p>
<h4 id="But-it-will-save-time"><a href="#But-it-will-save-time" class="headerlink" title="But it will save time!"></a>But it will save time!</h4><p>Will it?</p>
<p>If your code is so complex that adding in the “it might need to…” in the future is going to take more time than adding it in now, you probably have a fundamental problem with your code.</p>
<p>Worse, as mentioned above, you will probably never need it anyhow.  So, you’ve spent extra time now to save time you wouldn’t spend in the future if you were to just wait until you need it.</p>
<p>Aren’t you busy enough with deadlines as it is?</p>
<h2 id="Prevention"><a href="#Prevention" class="headerlink" title="Prevention:"></a>Prevention:</h2><p>So, then the next question is, “how do we prevent over architecting?”</p>
<p>Simple, you write Unit Test for all of the code you are writing.  If you are writing code so that it can be accessed in multiple ways, you’ll need to write test that prove it can be accessed in multiple ways.  Are you willing to do that?</p>
<p>When the tests need to be updated to reflect new business requirements, are you going to want to update them all?</p>
<p>So the next time you, or someone you knows says, “It might need to…” maybe you should ask them what the chances of them needing that really are and is it worth spending the extra time on it now.</p>

        <p>What could possibly be confusing about JavaScript Booleans you ask?</p>
<p>Well, here’s several logical statements written in JavaScript.  Do you know what each does?</p>
<p>if(“0” == true)</p>
<p>if(“0”)</p>
<p>if(“1” === true)</p>
<p>if(!!”0” == true)</p>

<h2 id="if-“0”-true"><a href="#if-“0”-true" class="headerlink" title="if(“0” == true)"></a>if(“0” == true)</h2><p>“0” == true</p>
<p>.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre { font-size: small; color: black; font-family: consolas, “Courier New”, courier, monospace; background-color: #ffffff; /*white-space: pre;*/ } .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; } .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; } .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; } .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; } .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; } .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; } .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; } .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; } .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; } .csharpcode .alt { background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; margin: 0em; } .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }resolves to false.  Why?  Because both sides of the equal are converted to numerics and then evaluated.  This gives us, 0 == 1 which is in fact false.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<h2 id="if-“0”"><a href="#if-“0”" class="headerlink" title="if(“0”) "></a>if(“0”) </h2><p>is true.  This is because there is no conversion needed.  Any string is truthy.</p>
<p>OK.  So then, what would you expect</p>
<h2 id="if-“1”-true"><a href="#if-“1”-true" class="headerlink" title="if(“1” === true)"></a>if(“1” === true)</h2><p>to be?  If you said, “true” you would be wrong.  And just when you thought you were getting the hang of this.</p>
<p>This puzzle illustrates the difference between the double equals (==) and triple equals (===) evaluators in JavaScript.  You see, if you use double equals, JavaScript will always convert both sides to a common type and then do the evaluation.  However, triple equals says that both sides have to be the same type and the same value to be equal.  Since a String is not a Boolean type, “1” === true evaluates to false.</p>
<p>Do you think you are getting the hang of this yet?  OK.  What does the next statement evaluate to?</p>
<h2 id="if-”0”-true"><a href="#if-”0”-true" class="headerlink" title="if(!!”0” == true)"></a>if(!!”0” == true)</h2><p>This evaluates to true.  If you thought it would be false, you probably applied the !! after the types were converted.  But the operator precedence on this is to apply the ! operators first.  So ! some valid string is false and ! false is true.  So true == true is true.</p>
<h2 id="The-operator"><a href="#The-operator" class="headerlink" title="The ! operator"></a>The ! operator</h2><p>The next two examples I gave were to simply point out that != is the opposite of double equal and !== is the opposite of triple equal.  Beyond that, they work the same.</p>
<p>So, if(“0” != true) would evaluate to true and if(“0” !== true) would also evaluate to true.</p>
<h2 id="if-someVariable"><a href="#if-someVariable" class="headerlink" title="if(someVariable)"></a>if(someVariable)</h2><p>The last set of examples illustrates what happens if a variable is undefined or null.</p>
<p>Since we never gave someVariable a value, it is undefined and so if(someVariable) would evaluate to false.  Undefined and null variables evaluate to falsy.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean that it is a boolean value.</p>
<p>So, if(someVariable == true) evaluates to false, if(someVariable === false) evaluates to false, if(!someVariable === true) evaluates to true and if(!!someVariable === true) evaluates to false.</p>
<h2 id="Implications"><a href="#Implications" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h2><p>The main implication of all of this is that if you are going to compare two variables for equality, you should first convert them to a common type and then compare them using the triple equals operator.</p>
<p>However, if you are just evaluating a variable for truthiness, using just the variable, as in if(someVariable) is clear enough.  You don’t gain much by using if(!!someVariable) or even if(!!someVariable === true) syntax.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Running Selenium in parallel from .NET seems to be a problem because, as of the time of this writing, I’ve yet to find a viable way of running selenium test on multiple browsers using <a href="//docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp">Selenium Grid</a>.  This doesn’t mean that there aren’t a few articles out there that have some kind of solution.  But they’ve never satisfied me as something that I could easily plug into my already created test. While my preferred testing tools are <a href="//www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> and <a href="//www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a>, the method I am about to propose should work with any existing test harness you might want to use.  The only prerequisite is that you are using <a href="//code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects">Page Models</a> to wrap your access to any particular web page. This article assumes that you already:</p>
<ul>
<li>know how to write Selenium tests</li>
<li>know how to use Selenium Grid</li>
<li>know how to use the Page Model pattern</li>
<li>know how to use your chosen test harness.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK.  On to the main event.</p>
<h2 id="Here-Is-The-Problem"><a href="#Here-Is-The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Here Is The Problem"></a>Here Is The Problem</h2><p>In order to run multiple browsers at the same time, the easiest way is to provide a wrapper Page Model that calls multiple instances of the page model at the same time. The hard way of doing this would be to create an Interface that represented the real page model and then create a proxy class that would hold a list of all of the real page model objects we needed to call.  Each time a property or method on the proxy gets called, all it would do would be to pass the call down into the real objects in parallel. This would work, but the main draw back is that I really don’t want to have to write a method for each method in my real page model.  So the question is, how can we get around this?</p>
<h2 id="DynamicObject-To-The-Rescue"><a href="#DynamicObject-To-The-Rescue" class="headerlink" title="DynamicObject To The Rescue"></a>DynamicObject To The Rescue</h2><p>Enter the little known class, <a href="//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.dynamic.dynamicobject(v=vs.110">DynamicObject</a>.aspx).   In .NET 4, Microsoft introduced the dynamic keyword.  One of the main uses is for places where  you need to be able to declare a variable in your code that the compiler won’t know how to resolve the type of until runtime.  I could have used this several years ago when I had two assemblies that needed to reference each other.  In that case, I used reflection.  But dynamic would have worked with a lot less work. DynamicObject is a specific class that allows us to resolve property and method calls at runtime using our own logic. We will also use the Task Parallel library to implement our parallel calls. For completeness, and so that no one is confused when they try to implement this code, you’ll need the following using statements at the top of the CS file.</p>
<h2 id="Using-Statements-And-Constructor"><a href="#Using-Statements-And-Constructor" class="headerlink" title="Using Statements And Constructor"></a>Using Statements And Constructor</h2><p>using System;<br>using System.Collections.Concurrent;<br>using System.Dynamic;<br>using System.Reflection;<br>using System.Threading.Tasks;</p>
<p>So, let’s get started.  The first thing we will need is a class declaration:</p>
<p>class ParallelPageModel<tpage>:  DynamicObject<br>{<br>}</tpage></p>
<p>TPage allows us to specify the Interface the real Page Model implements.  Yes, we still need the interface, but we won’t need to create a new wrapper class for every page model we want to wrap.  The class  inherits from DynamicObject so that all of our on the fly goodness will work. Next, we’ll need some place to store an array of PageObjects we want to proxy.  So we add a private variable _page for that purpose.</p>
<p>private readonly TPage[] _pages;</p>
<p>By using TPage[], we create a variable that is the same type array as the Page Models we are proxying. Next we need a constructor.</p>
<p>ParallelPageModel(params TPage[] pages)<br>{<br>    _pages = pages;<br>}</p>
<p>By using the params keyword, we can either  pass in page objects as an array or as individual parameters. The magic happens in three overridden methods that are in DynamicObject:</p>
<ul>
<li>TryInvokeMember – resolves any method calls.</li>
<li>TrySetMember – resolves any property setters</li>
<li>TryGetMember – resolves any property getters</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s add those methods next:</p>
<p>public override bool TryInvokeMember<br>    (InvokeMemberBinder binder,<br>      object[] args,<br>      out object result)<br>{<br>}</p>
<p>public override bool TrySetMember<br>    (SetMemberBinder binder, object value)<br>{<br>}</p>
<p>public override bool TryGetMember<br>    (GetMemberBinder binder, out object result)<br>{<br>}</p>
<h2 id="TryInvokeMember"><a href="#TryInvokeMember" class="headerlink" title="TryInvokeMember"></a>TryInvokeMember</h2><p>Inside of the TryInvokeMember method, the first thing we will want to do is to use reflection to call into the real methods.  Since we could have multiple instances of the same method we need to call we will want to do this in a loop. When I first worked this out, I started by just implementing a foreach loop but we are going to jump right to using Parallel.ForEach() Parallel.ForEach() will let us pass in an array and run a lambda expression on each element in the array.  So, our foreach loop will look like this:</p>
<p>var results = new ConcurrentBag<object>();<br>Parallel.ForEach(_pages, page =&gt;<br>{<br>    var thisResult = typeof (TPage)<br>       .InvokeMember(binder.Name,<br>        BindingFlags.InvokeMethod |<br>        BindingFlags.Public |<br>        BindingFlags.Instance,<br>        null, page, args);<br>    results.Add(thisResult);<br>});</object></p>
<p>Note that our lambda expression is not doing anything more than a simple reflection call. The result that is returned is added to our ConcurrentBag collection.  ConcurrentBag is a collection that is specifically made for parallel calls.  We could get into trouble if we added something to a List&lt;&gt; collection unless we added some parallelization gatekeeping around it.  I’m for doing as little work as possible. The second thing we want to do is to process the return results. For this we need to setup a basic foreach loop.</p>
<p>foreach (var thisResult in results)<br>{<br>}</p>
<p>Inside the foreach loop we will process the results collection. If the type that got  returned is the same type as the type that the page is proxying for, we just make our result value, the return value the TryInvokeMember is going to return for us to the code that called the proxy, equal to the proxy object.</p>
<p>if (thisResult is TPage)<br>{<br>    result = this;<br>}</p>
<p>If the result is not null, meaning either that a previous result was null or we haven’t processed the loop yet, we want to check to see if the value of the current loop result is the same as the loop results we’ve already processed.  If it isn’t, we throw an exception.</p>
<p>else if (result != null)<br>{<br>    if (!result.Equals(thisResult)) // not the same value<br>    {<br>        throw new Exception<br>           (“Call to method returns different values.”);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>Finally, we just set the result to whatever we have at this point.</p>
<p>else<br>{<br>    result = thisResult;<br>}</p>
<p>And then the last thing we want to do is to return true to tell the system we were able to process the method.</p>
<h2 id="TryGetMember"><a href="#TryGetMember" class="headerlink" title="TryGetMember"></a>TryGetMember</h2><p>Since the implementation for TryGetMember looks very similar to TryInvokeMethod we’ll tackle that next. In fact, the only difference between the two methods is the code inside of the Parallel.ForEach parameter block. So, here it is:</p>
<p>Parallel.ForEach(_pages, page =&gt;<br>{<br>    var thisResult = typeof(TPage)<br>        .GetProperty(binder.Name).GetValue(page);<br>    results.Add(thisResult);<br>});</p>
<h2 id="TrySetMember"><a href="#TrySetMember" class="headerlink" title="TrySetMember"></a>TrySetMember</h2><p>TrySetMember is the easiest implementation of all since there are no results to worry about.</p>
<p>Parallel.ForEach(_pages,<br>     page =&gt; typeof (TPage)<br>        .GetProperty(binder.Name).SetValue(page, value));<br>return true;</p>
<h2 id="Casting"><a href="#Casting" class="headerlink" title="Casting"></a>Casting</h2><p>So the code above will work, but you won’t get any intellisense help from Visual Studio if you use this code without tweaking it. What we need is some way of casting the ParallelPageModel object to the TPage type that we pass in. For that we are going to use a cool library I found called <a href="//github.com/ekonbenefits/impromptu-interface">ImpromptuInterface</a>. You’ll need to add a using statement.</p>
<p>using ImpromptuInterface;</p>
<p>And then you’ll need to add this method to the ParallelPageModel class.</p>
<p>public TPage Cast()<br>{<br>    return this.ActLike();<br>}</p>
<p>You would use this like this:</p>
<p>IMyPageModel p = pageModelProxy.Cast();</p>
<p>Where IMyPageModel is the interface that specifies what your real PageModel class looks like. Just in case someone is tempted to mention this in the comments, you can’t us operator overloading to achieve the cast because we need it to return TPage, which could be anything and the compiler can’t deal with that.  If you really want to use operator overloading you’ll need to provide your own specific implementation that ends up calling the code above.</p>
<h2 id="Calling-The-ParallelPageModel"><a href="#Calling-The-ParallelPageModel" class="headerlink" title="Calling The ParallelPageModel"></a>Calling The ParallelPageModel</h2><p>To setup the ParallelPageModel, your code would look something like this, assuming that you have a page model class called MyPageModel with an interface of IMyPageModel.</p>
<p>var pages = new ConcurrentStack<imypagemodel>();<br>Parallel.Invoke(<br>    () =><br>        pages.Push(PageFactory.GetPageModel(“FireFoxGrid”),<br>    () =><br>        pages.Push(PageFactory.GetPageModel(“IE11Grid”));<br>var pagesArray = pages.ToArray();<br>MyTypedPage =<br>    new ParallelPageModel<imypagemodel>(pagesArray).Cast();</imypagemodel></imypagemodel></p>
<h2 id="Considerations"><a href="#Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Considerations"></a>Considerations</h2><p>I only just started using this.  It works for my current implementation.  But you may need to tweak it so that it works for you. For example, my assumption here is that you are only dealing with simple types or the page model type you are a proxy for.  There is no code here that will handle a situation where the call to a method would return a entirely new page model. Since the code I am testing is a collection of Single Page Applications and I am not testing navigation at this point, this is not a consideration for me.  But it would be relatively easy code to implement.  If I did that, I would probably handle it but subclassing this main class that does the bulk of the work and override the Try*Member method that needed to deal with that situation.  The other possible way of dealing with the situation is to pass in a list of types that need to be wrapped in their own parallelization object as parameters in the constructor and add some generic code in the ParallelPageModel class. Finally, I am well aware that this code may have bugs.  If you find one, go ahead and fix it. You can leave a comment so that others will benefit.   There is a <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/ParallelSeleniumUsingNUnit">demo project on GitHub.</a></p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Last week I mentioned that I’m working toward getting my MCSD certification.  Several weeks ago I received my <a href="//www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/dbush2">ScrumMaster Certification</a>.  This raises the question, “Why get certified at all?” What follows is a list of reasons why I am perusing certification.</p>
<h2 id="I-don’t-know-what-I-don’t-know"><a href="#I-don’t-know-what-I-don’t-know" class="headerlink" title="I don’t know what I don’t know"></a>I don’t know what I don’t know</h2><p>I know what I know.  And I can figure stuff out pretty fast when I need to know it.  So working without certification has been working for me for a pretty long time.  However, while I was studying for my ScrumMaster Certification, I realized that while I had most of the concepts right, there where a few holes in my thinking.  Studying for the ScrumMaster certification filled in those holes.</p>
<h2 id="Authority"><a href="#Authority" class="headerlink" title="Authority"></a>Authority</h2><p>The reason I went after ScrumMaster certification was because everywhere I go, everyone has  their own definition of what Scrum looks like.  Most of them only know about Scrum from what they’ve heard about it from very informal sources. Only one that I know of is certified. But when I was talking about Scrum or Agile, it was my opinion against someone else’s opinion.  While I was sure I was right, if I were honest about it I had no more reason to believe I was right than anyone else. Now, with the certification, I have someone else saying I know what I’m talking about.  And since I got 100% of the 30, rather difficult, questions right, I have a higher confidence that my understanding of the subject is correct.</p>
<h2 id="Fear"><a href="#Fear" class="headerlink" title="Fear"></a>Fear</h2><p>After I passed the test for the ScrumMaster certification, I realized that I am afraid of tests.  I used to say that all a certification did was show that you could pass a test.  But I’ve realized recently that that may have just been a cover because I didn’t want to take the test and fail. So, the reason I’m going after my MCSD is because I’m afraid of the test.  So, I fail.  So what?  At least in the process of studying for the test I’ll learn a few things.  The worse thing that can happen is that I don’t get the certification.  Ironically, from that point of view, not trying to get certified puts me in the same, if not worse, situation.  Not studying means no certification AND I haven’t learned anything in the process of studying for the exams.</p>
<h2 id="Birds-of-a-feather"><a href="#Birds-of-a-feather" class="headerlink" title="Birds of a feather"></a>Birds of a feather</h2><p>I find it interesting that I personally only know one person who has their  MCSD.  Could that be because I don’t have MY MCSD?  Could it be that the organizations where all of the people who have their MCSD only hire people who have their MCSD?  I know several really good programmers.  Only one has their MCSD.  The others could get it if they wanted to.  But are they stuck in their current position because they aren’t certified?  It’s worth finding out.</p>
<h2 id="The-test-isn’t-a-joke-anymore"><a href="#The-test-isn’t-a-joke-anymore" class="headerlink" title="The test isn’t a joke anymore"></a>The test isn’t a joke anymore</h2><p>For the longest time, my attitude about the test, as I mentioned above, was that it only showed that you could pass the test.  It didn’t really say you knew how to program or that you knew how to use the APIs.  I’m not the only one who felt this way.  Do a search online and you’ll find statements from years ago that say as much. While I’m sure it might be possible to pass the exams and still know nothing about how to program or how to use the APIs, it does seems that Microsoft is doing a much better job at ensuring that people who pass this certification can actually do the work as well.</p>

        <p>I’m planning to get my MCSD certification next and the first exam I plan to take is the 70-483 which will test my knowledge of CSharp. To study, I got this free PDF: <a href="//www.it-ebooks.info/book/2564/">MCSD Certification Toolkit (Exam 70-483)</a> (Which I wouldn’t recommend, but I haven’t found anything yet that I WOULD recommend, so this will have to do.) In this book (Chapter 5) and other places on the web, it makes this statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a class contains no managed resources and no unmanaged resources, it doesn’t need to implement IDisposable or have a destructor.</li>
<li>If the class has only managed resources, it should implement IDisposable but it doesn’t need a destructor. (When the destructor executes, you can’t be sure managed objects still exist, so you can’t call their Dispose methods anyway.)</li>
<li>If the class has only unmanaged resources, it needs to implement IDisposable and needs a destructor in case the program doesn’t call Dispose.</li>
<li>The Dispose method must be safe to run more than once.  You can achieve that by using a variable to keep track of whether it has been run before.</li>
<li>The Dispose method should free both managed and unmanaged resources.</li>
<li>The destructor should free only unmanaged resources.  (When the destructor executes, you can’t be sure managed objects still exist, so you can’t call their Dispose methods anyway.)</li>
<li>After freeing resources, the destructor should call GC.SuppressFinalize, so the object can skip the finalization queue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Managed-VS-Unmanaged"><a href="#Managed-VS-Unmanaged" class="headerlink" title="Managed VS Unmanaged?"></a>Managed VS Unmanaged?</h2><p>So what is the difference between a managed resource and an unmanaged resource?  An unmanaged resource is something that is not under the direct control of the .NET memory manager.  So, file handles, connections to the database, memory handles, and other OS items fall under the realm of “unmanaged.”  Managed code is everything else. So, if you read the points above and read the statements about managed resources, you would think, or should think, “That’s already under the control of the .NET memory manager, so I shouldn’t have to do ANYTHING!” But with one little tweak, this all becomes clear.  What this block of text is talking about specifically is managed code that is referencing other code that implements IDisposable.</p>
<h2 id="Corrected-Version"><a href="#Corrected-Version" class="headerlink" title="Corrected Version"></a>Corrected Version</h2><p>So, let’s rephrase the block of text to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a class contains no managed resources that implement IDisposable and no unmanaged resources, it doesn’t need to implement IDisposable or have a destructor.</li>
<li>If the class has only managed resources that reference resources that implement IDisposable, it should implement IDisposable but it doesn’t need a destructor. (When the destructor executes, you can’t be sure managed objects still exist, so you can’t call their Dispose methods anyway.)</li>
<li>If the class has only unmanaged resources, it needs to implement IDisposable and needs a destructor in case the program doesn’t call Dispose.</li>
<li>The Dispose method must be safe to run more than once.  You can achieve that by using a variable to keep track of whether it has been run before.</li>
<li>The Dispose method should free both managed resources that implement IDisposable and unmanaged resources.</li>
<li>The destructor should free only unmanaged resources.  (When the destructor executes, you can’t be sure managed objects still exist, so you can’t call their Dispose methods anyway.)</li>
<li>After freeing resources, the destructor should call GC.SuppressFinalize, so the object can skip the finalization queue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="One-Other-Circumstance"><a href="#One-Other-Circumstance" class="headerlink" title="One Other Circumstance"></a>One Other Circumstance</h2><p>There is one other situation where you might want to implement IDisposable on a class that doesn’t reference an object that implements IDisposable.  While this particular case is rare, I think it is probably good to list it here for completeness. If you have a class that will consume a lot of memory either directly or indirectly, you might want to consider implementing IDisposable and the Dispose method so that any class that is calling this method has a way of immediately releasing the memory the class is using by dereferencing the memory it is using, and then calling:</p>
<pre><code>GC.Collect();
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
GC.Collect();
</code></pre><p>I can already hear some of you saying, “but you shouldn’t have to ever need to do this!” And yes, 99% of the time, you shouldn’t.  But, if you have an issue with this, talk to <a href="//www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/developer-training-with-programming-in-c">the guys over at the Microsoft Virtual Academy</a> where I learned this.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I mention <a href="/are-we-there-yet/">“definition of done”</a> which many of my readers may have never heard of before. The phrase, “definition of done” comes out of the agile movement.  But there is no reason why it needs to stay there.  In fact, I would argue that many of the problems we have in the software industry are because most organizations only have one definition of done, “If we ship this today, can we make money?” When the Agile people talk about “definition of done” what they ultimately mean is, “if we were to ship this product today,and someone were to inspect what we’ve done, would we be embarrassed?” Definition of done, is about the quality of the code. When thinking about the definition of done, here are some items you might consider.</p>
<h4 id="Does-the-code-meet-the-requirements-of-the-user-story"><a href="#Does-the-code-meet-the-requirements-of-the-user-story" class="headerlink" title="Does the code meet the requirements of the user story?"></a>Does the code meet the requirements of the user story?</h4><p>This is the most obvious.  Of course for this to work, you have to have a user story that is specific enough for you to answer this question.</p>
<h4 id="Has-all-of-the-documentation-that-the-organization-requires-been-updated"><a href="#Has-all-of-the-documentation-that-the-organization-requires-been-updated" class="headerlink" title="Has all of the documentation that the organization requires been updated?"></a>Has all of the documentation that the organization requires been updated?</h4><p>This one can fall through the cracks easily because documentation is the least favorite activity of a programmer.  But, it isn’t necessarily a programmer activity.  Remember, an ideal team has all of the skills it needs.  So, if you have a documentation requirement, be it an ISO requirement or simple end user documentation telling them how to use the software, your team should have someone on it that can produce this documentation.</p>
<h4 id="Does-the-code-have-a-reasonable-level-of-unit-tests"><a href="#Does-the-code-have-a-reasonable-level-of-unit-tests" class="headerlink" title="Does the code have a reasonable level of unit tests?"></a>Does the code have a reasonable level of unit tests?</h4><p>I say “reasonable” here because the principle is high code coverage where we need it.  To try to aim for some metric will cause us to write tests where we don’t need them.  By combining a “reasonableness” level with code reviews, I think we can hit this target without setting an unrealistic arbitrary limit.</p>
<h4 id="Do-all-of-the-unit-tests-succeed"><a href="#Do-all-of-the-unit-tests-succeed" class="headerlink" title="Do all of the unit tests succeed?"></a>Do all of the unit tests succeed?</h4><p>You’d think this one would be obvious.  You have tests, you should be running them every time the code changes.  But, I’ve seen situations where tests sit in version control and never get run. Run your tests!</p>
<h4 id="Is-the-code-covered-by-system-level-tests"><a href="#Is-the-code-covered-by-system-level-tests" class="headerlink" title="Is the code covered by system level tests?"></a>Is the code covered by system level tests?</h4><p>Once again, this one should be obvious.  Just because you have unit tests, doesn’t mean the system works.  The main problem with the Federal Health Care web site that went live in the United States recently is because no one made sure all of the parts worked together. And don’t leave this to manual testing.  There are many ways of testing at this level that you can automate.</p>
<h4 id="Do-all-of-the-system-tests-succeed"><a href="#Do-all-of-the-system-tests-succeed" class="headerlink" title="Do all of the system tests succeed?"></a>Do all of the system tests succeed?</h4><p>Once again, run your tests.</p>
<h4 id="Has-the-code-been-reviewed-by-one-other-programmer"><a href="#Has-the-code-been-reviewed-by-one-other-programmer" class="headerlink" title="Has the code been reviewed by one other programmer?"></a>Has the code been reviewed by one other programmer?</h4><p>If there isn’t at least one other programmer on your team that understands what you’ve done, you aren’t done.  I could, and probably will, write a whole post about this sometime.</p>
<h4 id="Have-coding-conventions-been-observed-throughout-the-code"><a href="#Have-coding-conventions-been-observed-throughout-the-code" class="headerlink" title="Have coding conventions been observed throughout the code?"></a>Have coding conventions been observed throughout the code?</h4><p>There are a number of tools out there  that check for coding conventions.  For CSharp, I like ReSharper.  JsHint is what I prefer for JavaScript.  There is  FxCop built into Visual Studio. Pick a standard, find a way to automatically verify the code meets the standard, and make sure nothing gets put into version control that doesn’t meet the standard!</p>
<h4 id="Has-the-code-passed-some-level-of-complexity-threshold"><a href="#Has-the-code-passed-some-level-of-complexity-threshold" class="headerlink" title="Has the code passed some level of complexity threshold?"></a>Has the code passed some level of complexity threshold?</h4><p>I’ve talked about <a href="/avoiding-code-complexity/">code complexity</a> before.  Just go read that post.</p>
<h4 id="Is-there-any-known-code-duplication"><a href="#Is-there-any-known-code-duplication" class="headerlink" title="Is there any known code duplication?"></a>Is there any known code duplication?</h4><p>Again, there are tools for this.  Find one and use it.</p>

<pre><code>long l = long.MaxValue;
int i;
i = (int) l;
</code></pre><p>Well, if we are working with the compiler set with default settings, you’ll end up with the variable l having the value of 9223372036854775807 and the value of i having the value of -1.</p>
<p>Why is this?  Because, by default, .NET does not check for numeric overflow.</p>
<p>However, if you wanted to add the ability to check for numeric overflow, you would wrap this code in a checked block.</p>
<pre><code>try
{
    checked
    {
        long l = long.MaxValue;
        int i;
        i = (int)l;
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // handle overflow exception here 
}
</code></pre><p>You can force all of your code to be checked by changing your compiler settings.  In Visual Studio 2013, go to Project Properties –&gt; Build.  Click the “Advanced” button (bottom right corner) and then check the “Check for … overflow” checkbox.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done that, all of your code will be checked by default.  If you don’t want to check for overflows while you are working on a block of code, for performance reasons, wrap the code in an unchecked block instead.</p>
<h2 id="Float-to-Int"><a href="#Float-to-Int" class="headerlink" title="Float to Int"></a>Float to Int</h2><p>Now, what about putting a floating point number in an integer?</p>
<p>Let’s say that instead of a long, we use a float.</p>
<p>First, let’s look at a simple case:</p>
<pre><code>float l = 3.563f;
int i;
i = (int) lf
</code></pre><p>In this case, you’ll end up with f holding a floating point number of 3.563 and i holding an integer of 3.  The rule is pretty simple, floats always have the decimal portion stripped off and assigned to the integer, short, or long.</p>
<h2 id="Large-Float-to-Int"><a href="#Large-Float-to-Int" class="headerlink" title="Large Float to Int"></a>Large Float to Int</h2><p>But what happens if we use float.MaxValue?</p>
<pre><code>float f = float.MaxValue;
int i;
i = (int) f;
</code></pre><p>In this case, what you’ll end up with is a very large floating point number and an integer of -2147483648.  Basically it does it’s best to convert a really large integer number into the int and just uses what it can.  Not really what you probably have in mind.</p>
<p>The solution is the same.  Use a checked block or compile with checked turned on.</p>
<h2 id="Double-to-Float"><a href="#Double-to-Float" class="headerlink" title="Double to Float"></a>Double to Float</h2><p>Now, you would expect that if I had a really large double and tried to assign that to a float, something similar would happen. </p>
<p>You’d be right, kind of.</p>
<p>If you assign a double that is too large for a float to a float variable, the float variable will end up with infinity.  But, unlike the shorts, ints, and longs, you can’t wrap the code in a checked block to cause it to throw an exception.  No.  In this case you must always check for infinity once you’ve done the assignment.</p>
<pre><code>double d = double.MaxValue;
float f;
f = (float)d;
if(float.IsInfinity(f))
    // do something intelligent here
</code></pre><p>So there you have it.  This is how you really deal with numeric casting in your CSharp code.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2014/06/StoryPoints.png" alt="StoryPoints" title="StoryPoints">When my kids were young, my wife introduced a concept for this question that she got from her family that is so brilliant in its simplicity that I wonder that this isn’t common knowledge with all parents.  Something they should tell you during Lamaze class. When the kids asked, “Are we there yet?” Which they did very infrequently, we would answer, “Just a few more units.” If you think about it, it is just about as helpful as any other answer we could have given them, “Just a few more hours.”, “Just a few more miles.”, “Sure, get out of the car.” (While continuing to drive the car down the road.) Or “Does it look like we are there yet?” What does the child want to know?  Nothing, they are just expressing their displeasure at still being in the car.</p>
<h2 id="Story-Points"><a href="#Story-Points" class="headerlink" title="Story Points"></a>Story Points</h2><p>Story Points remind me of “Just a few more units.”  While “Just a few more units,” had no real meaning, Story Points do have meaning, but they don’t answer the question, “how long until we are done?”  Story Points don’t represent time, they represent difficulty.  Given two stories, a story with 2 story points should be twice as difficult as a story with 1 story point assuming that everything is as it should be.  It does not take into account that the code might have technical debt that we need to deal with prior to actually implementing the story.  It doesn’t take into account which programmer is going to do the work.  It just says, “This story is this much easier or harder than that story.” How long will it take to complete the story?  “Just a few more units.” “But wait!”  You say, “How can anyone plan a project if they don’t know how long something is going to take? Well, I have two answers to that question.</p>
<h2 id="How-Accurately-Do-You-Estimate"><a href="#How-Accurately-Do-You-Estimate" class="headerlink" title="How Accurately Do You Estimate?"></a>How Accurately Do You Estimate?</h2><p>First, if you look at how well you estimate projects now.  How’s that working for you? If you are a programmer, you might say, “Yeah, we hit the estimate every time.”  But do you?  I would be willing to bet that when you estimated a project, you had in mind that you would do a certain number of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect the requirements</li>
<li>Write a nice user interface</li>
<li>Write clean backend code</li>
<li>Have the application tested completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I suspect really happened is that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect enough requirements to get going and made up a significant number of the rest.</li>
<li>Wrote an adequate user interface</li>
<li>Clean code?  No, you were just glad to get it all working.</li>
<li>Testing?  We don’t have time for testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you didn’t meet your estimate, you adjusted you scope so you could meet a target date.</p>
<h2 id="Estimates-Are-More-Accurate-Over-Time"><a href="#Estimates-Are-More-Accurate-Over-Time" class="headerlink" title="Estimates Are More Accurate Over Time"></a>Estimates Are More Accurate Over Time</h2><p>Now, if you use story points AND you concentrate on a well-established definition of done for each story.  The programmers can concentrate on writing quality code, and over time, management will learn how long a story point is on average. No, you’ll never know how long a story point will take for any one story.  But you will know that if you look at all of the stories we’ve done so far, a story point equals X amount of time. By doing this we achieve two major milestones.  First, we move the decisions about what to do or not do up to the management level.  Management will be able to see quickly that if we continue at the rate we are going, we will have a releasable product by such and such a date.  Second, the programmers can concentrate on writing good code rather than writing code that is simply adequate for today but ends up slowing them down in the future because they were too busy concentrating on delivering “on time.”</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2014/06/clip_image001.png" alt="clip_image001" title="clip_image001">A couple of weeks ago, I talked a bit about how we name things.  Specifically, I talked about the <a href="/i-j-and-k-should-die/">very bad habit of using the variables i, j, and k as variables in our for/next loops</a>. A few weeks before that, I talked about <a href="/dry-programming/">DRY Programming</a> and the fact that not repeating ourselves extends much farther than most of us normally think when we are thinking about our code. Today I want to continue on the general theme of code quality by discussing code complexity. </p>
<h2 id="What-is-it"><a href="#What-is-it" class="headerlink" title="What is it?"></a>What is it?</h2><p>Generally, code complexity is anything you introduce into your code that makes it hard to follow.  But here are a few areas you might look for code complexity.</p>
<h2 id="Do-you-have-REALLY-long-methods"><a href="#Do-you-have-REALLY-long-methods" class="headerlink" title="Do you have REALLY long methods?"></a>Do you have REALLY long methods?</h2><p>Here’s the deal.  The longer your method is, the more work it will be to keep track of the overall point of the method.  So, you want to keep the number of lines in your method low.  If you are doing too much, when you come back to your code, even you will be confused. I remember when I first started programming.  We only had 25 lines for a full screen, and the rule was, you should be able to see the full function or method on one screen full of code in your editor.  The problem with that metric now is that our screens have gotten capable of showing a lot more code.  It’s a lot like telling a new driver, he should be able to still see the license plates of the car in front of him when he stops behind a car.  Some cars exist where my tiny little Civic would be IN the other car and I’d still be able to see the plates. A better metric would be to use the 7 +/- 2 rule.  Ideally no more than 7 lines of functional code per method.  If you have to, you can fudge it to up to 9, but no more.  This is because the human brain can only deal with about 7 items at a time. I can think of a few times when you might want to break this rule, like when you have a set of conditions that really need to all be in the same place for them to make sense, but it wouldn’t hurt to try to keep to the rule as often as possible.</p>
<h2 id="Do-you-have-a-lot-of-conditions-within-one-method"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-lot-of-conditions-within-one-method" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a lot of conditions within one method?"></a><strong>Do you have a lot of conditions within one method?</strong></h2><p>When I was discussing the problem with using i, j, and k as variables, I kind of mentioned this, but I didn’t dwell on the subject a lot. You see, the story I told when I was telling you all about the i, j, and k problem violated all of the readability rules.  First, it was using the wrong variable names.  Second, the method was MUCH too long.  And third it had too many conditions. You might think that only if/else statements are conditions.  But so are for/next, while, do/while, and switch statements.  As much as you can, your code should be setup so that you only have one condition per method.  Three at the most.  Again, switch statements might loose their context, but here, I would have one method that handles the switch statement and only one line per case statement.  Each case statement should call a function that does the real work. There is a tool in Visual Studio 2013 that will help you determine how bad your methods are.  You can calculate metrics for a project or the entire solution and it will generate a table of the Cyclomatic complexity of your code.  Look for methods that have a Cyclomatic complexity of over 10 and try to bring them down.  The closer to  zero you get, the better.  Many people suggest that we keep this number below 10 or 11, but this is just an opinion.  I would rather just say look at what you’ve currently got and strive for better. If you have Visual Studio, this option is under the Analyze menu option.</p>
<h2 id="Do-you-have-a-lot-of-operations-function-calls-parameters-to-those-calls"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-lot-of-operations-function-calls-parameters-to-those-calls" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a lot of operations, function calls, parameters to those calls?"></a>Do you have a lot of operations, function calls, parameters to those calls?</h2><p>What I’m basically talking about here is what’s called Halstead Volume or Halstead Metrics.  What this computes is how complex the code is. For example, if you have five lines of code and a Cyclomatic complexity of ten as everyone suggest, your code may still be in trouble because each line of code is so complex that no one on earth could possibly understand it. We call this self obfuscating code. You probably have some superstar on your team that thinks he’s so hot that he codes an entire function on one line.  The problem with this is that six months from now, neither he nor you will be able to figure out what the code does.  Any fix that will be needed will require an entire rewrite of the code.  That’s exactly what we are trying to prevent. If you are using Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate, you can get the <a href="//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f85a7ab9-b4c2-436c-a6e5-0f06e0bac16d">Microsoft Codelens Code Health Indicator</a> which adds the ability to check for all three of the above problems for each of your methods.  If you pay attention to it, it will help you make code that is easier to understand.</p>
<h2 id="Can-You-Easily-Find-Code-You-Need-To-Maintain"><a href="#Can-You-Easily-Find-Code-You-Need-To-Maintain" class="headerlink" title="Can You Easily Find Code You Need To Maintain?"></a>Can You Easily Find Code You Need To Maintain?</h2><p>This is one that is harder to detect, but I thought I’d mention it here because it is a real issue. In an ideal world, we shouldn’t need to use a debugger to track down where the code is that we need to modify.  There are cases where this may be the only solution.  But you should know, for example, that all of your validation code is in this one location.  If you have validation code in multiple locations, you are probably thinking about your code incorrectly. But also cut yourself some slack because this kind of code complexity is not something you are going to notice until late in your project.  You may never see it, but you will certainly recognize it when you run into it in someone else’s code.</p>
<h2 id="Which-reminds-me-of-a-story"><a href="#Which-reminds-me-of-a-story" class="headerlink" title="Which reminds me of a story."></a>Which reminds me of a story.</h2><p>There was this guy that was working in a cube and he suddenly starts ranting.  “Who wrote this code?!  This is the dumbest code I’ve ever seen.  etc…”  Suddenly he got real quiet and the guy in the next cube asked him, “hey, Joe, what’s wrong?”  Joe replies, “It’s my code.” So even if you don’t pay attention to these issues for your coworker’s sake.  Do it for yourself.</p>

        <h2 id="…And-why-do-I-want-it"><a href="#…And-why-do-I-want-it" class="headerlink" title="…And why do I want it?"></a>…And why do I want it?</h2><p><img src="/uploads/2014/06/SpecFlow.png" alt="SpecFlow" title="SpecFlow">That’s what I kept asking myself every time I saw this product. Well, the last time I looked, something caught my eye enough that I decided to download it and take a look. I’m really glad I did it. So, let me attempt to explain what <a href="//www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> is.  First, while you can get SpecFlow+ Runner to run your test, this isn’t a completely new testing platform. Instead, it is a testing platform that works with whatever testing platform you are using to test your .NET code. So, it works with NUnit, MSTest, xUnit and MbUnit. This is good for my situation because any test I write with SpecFlow will continue to work with the tools I already have in place. Including my current test runners (<a href="//www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>) and my Continuous Integration system (<a href="//www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a>). I wasn’t interested in adopting a platform that wouldn’t work with these two platforms.</p>
<h2 id="Where-I-got-Confused"><a href="#Where-I-got-Confused" class="headerlink" title="Where I got Confused"></a>Where I got Confused</h2><p>Now the part that kept me from looking at this framework for such a long time was the <a href="//www.specflow.org/">home page</a>. If you go there, you will see the “Three easy steps.” 1) Specify, 2) Automate, 3) enjoy. Well, at first glance it looked like was going to have to write my test in English and then write my test in code and then I could enjoy. Why would I want to do that? So, the part they forgot to mention is that once you’ve specified your test, the Visual Studio plugin will generate your test code for you. For NUnit it actually writes the NUnit test for you. The code you do have to write is the code that translates the individual steps. But even that code gets stubbed out for you. Once you have enough of those stubbed out, to write a test, you just write the test in English, save the file, and run the test. Now that I finally understand this, I like most of what SpecFlow does. But there are a few things I wish it did differently.</p>
<h2 id="What-I-like"><a href="#What-I-like" class="headerlink" title="What I like:"></a>What I like:</h2><p>1) It puts my test in a Given, When, Then structure like I mentioned a few weeks ago. 2) The class files it generates are all partial classes. This allowed me to keep my inheritance structure that I’m dependent on for my current NUnit testing framework. And allowed me to work around one of the shortcomings I’ve found. 3) The methods are all virtual, again, allowing for extension and flexibility. 4) Intellisense is enabled so you can see similar sentences you’ve already used as you are creating new test. 5) You can create tables of parameters for test scenarios, similar to how you can pass multiple parameters to an NUnit test with the TestCase attribute or the TestCaseSource attribute. 6) To write the supporting CSharp, code I didn’t have to learn anything new. 7) I can give the English language, none code, document to the business user and they should be able to read the test well enough to tell me if the test is an accurate reflection of what they want the system to do.</p>
<h2 id="What-I-don’t-like"><a href="#What-I-don’t-like" class="headerlink" title="What I don’t like:"></a>What I don’t like:</h2><p>1) I’ve become pretty dependent on the NUnit TestFixture attribute that allows me to pass parameters to the entire test. I use this to control the testing of multiple browsers. But, I’ve recently figured out a way to run all of my browsers simultaneously rather than sequentially so I won’t need this feature in the pretty near future. Once I’ve got that working, you can be sure I’ll share it here. So, don’t forget to subscribe to this blog if you haven’t already.</p>
