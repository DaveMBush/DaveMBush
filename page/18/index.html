    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I mention <a href="/are-we-there-yet/">“definition of done”</a> which many of my readers may have never heard of before. The phrase, “definition of done” comes out of the agile movement.  But there is no reason why it needs to stay there.  In fact, I would argue that many of the problems we have in the software industry are because most organizations only have one definition of done, “If we ship this today, can we make money?” When the Agile people talk about “definition of done” what they ultimately mean is, “if we were to ship this product today,and someone were to inspect what we’ve done, would we be embarrassed?” Definition of done, is about the quality of the code. When thinking about the definition of done, here are some items you might consider.</p>
<h4 id="Does-the-code-meet-the-requirements-of-the-user-story"><a href="#Does-the-code-meet-the-requirements-of-the-user-story" class="headerlink" title="Does the code meet the requirements of the user story?"></a>Does the code meet the requirements of the user story?</h4><p>This is the most obvious.  Of course for this to work, you have to have a user story that is specific enough for you to answer this question.</p>
<h4 id="Has-all-of-the-documentation-that-the-organization-requires-been-updated"><a href="#Has-all-of-the-documentation-that-the-organization-requires-been-updated" class="headerlink" title="Has all of the documentation that the organization requires been updated?"></a>Has all of the documentation that the organization requires been updated?</h4><p>This one can fall through the cracks easily because documentation is the least favorite activity of a programmer.  But, it isn’t necessarily a programmer activity.  Remember, an ideal team has all of the skills it needs.  So, if you have a documentation requirement, be it an ISO requirement or simple end user documentation telling them how to use the software, your team should have someone on it that can produce this documentation.</p>
<h4 id="Does-the-code-have-a-reasonable-level-of-unit-tests"><a href="#Does-the-code-have-a-reasonable-level-of-unit-tests" class="headerlink" title="Does the code have a reasonable level of unit tests?"></a>Does the code have a reasonable level of unit tests?</h4><p>I say “reasonable” here because the principle is high code coverage where we need it.  To try to aim for some metric will cause us to write tests where we don’t need them.  By combining a “reasonableness” level with code reviews, I think we can hit this target without setting an unrealistic arbitrary limit.</p>
<h4 id="Do-all-of-the-unit-tests-succeed"><a href="#Do-all-of-the-unit-tests-succeed" class="headerlink" title="Do all of the unit tests succeed?"></a>Do all of the unit tests succeed?</h4><p>You’d think this one would be obvious.  You have tests, you should be running them every time the code changes.  But, I’ve seen situations where tests sit in version control and never get run. Run your tests!</p>
<h4 id="Is-the-code-covered-by-system-level-tests"><a href="#Is-the-code-covered-by-system-level-tests" class="headerlink" title="Is the code covered by system level tests?"></a>Is the code covered by system level tests?</h4><p>Once again, this one should be obvious.  Just because you have unit tests, doesn’t mean the system works.  The main problem with the Federal Health Care web site that went live in the United States recently is because no one made sure all of the parts worked together. And don’t leave this to manual testing.  There are many ways of testing at this level that you can automate.</p>
<h4 id="Do-all-of-the-system-tests-succeed"><a href="#Do-all-of-the-system-tests-succeed" class="headerlink" title="Do all of the system tests succeed?"></a>Do all of the system tests succeed?</h4><p>Once again, run your tests.</p>
<h4 id="Has-the-code-been-reviewed-by-one-other-programmer"><a href="#Has-the-code-been-reviewed-by-one-other-programmer" class="headerlink" title="Has the code been reviewed by one other programmer?"></a>Has the code been reviewed by one other programmer?</h4><p>If there isn’t at least one other programmer on your team that understands what you’ve done, you aren’t done.  I could, and probably will, write a whole post about this sometime.</p>
<h4 id="Have-coding-conventions-been-observed-throughout-the-code"><a href="#Have-coding-conventions-been-observed-throughout-the-code" class="headerlink" title="Have coding conventions been observed throughout the code?"></a>Have coding conventions been observed throughout the code?</h4><p>There are a number of tools out there  that check for coding conventions.  For CSharp, I like ReSharper.  JsHint is what I prefer for JavaScript.  There is  FxCop built into Visual Studio. Pick a standard, find a way to automatically verify the code meets the standard, and make sure nothing gets put into version control that doesn’t meet the standard!</p>
<h4 id="Has-the-code-passed-some-level-of-complexity-threshold"><a href="#Has-the-code-passed-some-level-of-complexity-threshold" class="headerlink" title="Has the code passed some level of complexity threshold?"></a>Has the code passed some level of complexity threshold?</h4><p>I’ve talked about <a href="/avoiding-code-complexity/">code complexity</a> before.  Just go read that post.</p>
<h4 id="Is-there-any-known-code-duplication"><a href="#Is-there-any-known-code-duplication" class="headerlink" title="Is there any known code duplication?"></a>Is there any known code duplication?</h4><p>Again, there are tools for this.  Find one and use it.</p>
<h4 id="When-you-compile-are-there-warnings"><a href="#When-you-compile-are-there-warnings" class="headerlink" title="When you compile, are there warnings?"></a>When you compile, are there warnings?</h4><p><a href="/treat-warnings-as-errors/">Compiling without warnings</a> is something else I’ve already talked about.   </p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2014/06/NumericOverflow.png" alt="NumericOverflow" title="NumericOverflow">Did you know that when you are dealing with numbers, by default, .NET will do, or try to do exactly what you tell it to do?  If you tell it to do the impossible, it will do the next most logical thing.  It won’t throw any errors in the process.</p>
<p>No, neither did I.  But then, most of the time I don’t write code where this would matter, and I bet you don’t either.</p>
<p>So here are some examples.</p>
<h2 id="Integer-Types"><a href="#Integer-Types" class="headerlink" title="Integer Types"></a>Integer Types</h2><p>What happens if you write code that looks like this?</p>
<pre><code>long l = long.MaxValue;
int i;
i = (int) l;
</code></pre><p>Well, if we are working with the compiler set with default settings, you’ll end up with the variable l having the value of 9223372036854775807 and the value of i having the value of -1.</p>
<p>Why is this?  Because, by default, .NET does not check for numeric overflow.</p>
<p>However, if you wanted to add the ability to check for numeric overflow, you would wrap this code in a checked block.</p>
<pre><code>try
{
    checked
    {
        long l = long.MaxValue;
        int i;
        i = (int)l;
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // handle overflow exception here 
}
</code></pre><p>You can force all of your code to be checked by changing your compiler settings.  In Visual Studio 2013, go to Project Properties –&gt; Build.  Click the “Advanced” button (bottom right corner) and then check the “Check for … overflow” checkbox.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done that, all of your code will be checked by default.  If you don’t want to check for overflows while you are working on a block of code, for performance reasons, wrap the code in an unchecked block instead.</p>
<h2 id="Float-to-Int"><a href="#Float-to-Int" class="headerlink" title="Float to Int"></a>Float to Int</h2><p>Now, what about putting a floating point number in an integer?</p>
<p>Let’s say that instead of a long, we use a float.</p>
<p>First, let’s look at a simple case:</p>
<pre><code>float l = 3.563f;
int i;
i = (int) lf
</code></pre><p>In this case, you’ll end up with f holding a floating point number of 3.563 and i holding an integer of 3.  The rule is pretty simple, floats always have the decimal portion stripped off and assigned to the integer, short, or long.</p>
<h2 id="Large-Float-to-Int"><a href="#Large-Float-to-Int" class="headerlink" title="Large Float to Int"></a>Large Float to Int</h2><p>But what happens if we use float.MaxValue?</p>
<pre><code>float f = float.MaxValue;
int i;
i = (int) f;
</code></pre><p>In this case, what you’ll end up with is a very large floating point number and an integer of -2147483648.  Basically it does it’s best to convert a really large integer number into the int and just uses what it can.  Not really what you probably have in mind.</p>
<p>The solution is the same.  Use a checked block or compile with checked turned on.</p>
<h2 id="Double-to-Float"><a href="#Double-to-Float" class="headerlink" title="Double to Float"></a>Double to Float</h2><p>Now, you would expect that if I had a really large double and tried to assign that to a float, something similar would happen. </p>
<p>You’d be right, kind of.</p>
<p>If you assign a double that is too large for a float to a float variable, the float variable will end up with infinity.  But, unlike the shorts, ints, and longs, you can’t wrap the code in a checked block to cause it to throw an exception.  No.  In this case you must always check for infinity once you’ve done the assignment.</p>
<pre><code>double d = double.MaxValue;
float f;
f = (float)d;
if(float.IsInfinity(f))
    // do something intelligent here
</code></pre><p>So there you have it.  This is how you really deal with numeric casting in your CSharp code.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2014/06/StoryPoints.png" alt="StoryPoints" title="StoryPoints">When my kids were young, my wife introduced a concept for this question that she got from her family that is so brilliant in its simplicity that I wonder that this isn’t common knowledge with all parents.  Something they should tell you during Lamaze class. When the kids asked, “Are we there yet?” Which they did very infrequently, we would answer, “Just a few more units.” If you think about it, it is just about as helpful as any other answer we could have given them, “Just a few more hours.”, “Just a few more miles.”, “Sure, get out of the car.” (While continuing to drive the car down the road.) Or “Does it look like we are there yet?” What does the child want to know?  Nothing, they are just expressing their displeasure at still being in the car.</p>
<h2 id="Story-Points"><a href="#Story-Points" class="headerlink" title="Story Points"></a>Story Points</h2><p>Story Points remind me of “Just a few more units.”  While “Just a few more units,” had no real meaning, Story Points do have meaning, but they don’t answer the question, “how long until we are done?”  Story Points don’t represent time, they represent difficulty.  Given two stories, a story with 2 story points should be twice as difficult as a story with 1 story point assuming that everything is as it should be.  It does not take into account that the code might have technical debt that we need to deal with prior to actually implementing the story.  It doesn’t take into account which programmer is going to do the work.  It just says, “This story is this much easier or harder than that story.” How long will it take to complete the story?  “Just a few more units.” “But wait!”  You say, “How can anyone plan a project if they don’t know how long something is going to take? Well, I have two answers to that question.</p>
<h2 id="How-Accurately-Do-You-Estimate"><a href="#How-Accurately-Do-You-Estimate" class="headerlink" title="How Accurately Do You Estimate?"></a>How Accurately Do You Estimate?</h2><p>First, if you look at how well you estimate projects now.  How’s that working for you? If you are a programmer, you might say, “Yeah, we hit the estimate every time.”  But do you?  I would be willing to bet that when you estimated a project, you had in mind that you would do a certain number of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect the requirements</li>
<li>Write a nice user interface</li>
<li>Write clean backend code</li>
<li>Have the application tested completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I suspect really happened is that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect enough requirements to get going and made up a significant number of the rest.</li>
<li>Wrote an adequate user interface</li>
<li>Clean code?  No, you were just glad to get it all working.</li>
<li>Testing?  We don’t have time for testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you didn’t meet your estimate, you adjusted you scope so you could meet a target date.</p>
<h2 id="Estimates-Are-More-Accurate-Over-Time"><a href="#Estimates-Are-More-Accurate-Over-Time" class="headerlink" title="Estimates Are More Accurate Over Time"></a>Estimates Are More Accurate Over Time</h2><p>Now, if you use story points AND you concentrate on a well-established definition of done for each story.  The programmers can concentrate on writing quality code, and over time, management will learn how long a story point is on average. No, you’ll never know how long a story point will take for any one story.  But you will know that if you look at all of the stories we’ve done so far, a story point equals X amount of time. By doing this we achieve two major milestones.  First, we move the decisions about what to do or not do up to the management level.  Management will be able to see quickly that if we continue at the rate we are going, we will have a releasable product by such and such a date.  Second, the programmers can concentrate on writing good code rather than writing code that is simply adequate for today but ends up slowing them down in the future because they were too busy concentrating on delivering “on time.”</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2014/06/clip_image001.png" alt="clip_image001" title="clip_image001">A couple of weeks ago, I talked a bit about how we name things.  Specifically, I talked about the <a href="/i-j-and-k-should-die/">very bad habit of using the variables i, j, and k as variables in our for/next loops</a>. A few weeks before that, I talked about <a href="/dry-programming/">DRY Programming</a> and the fact that not repeating ourselves extends much farther than most of us normally think when we are thinking about our code. Today I want to continue on the general theme of code quality by discussing code complexity. </p>
<h2 id="What-is-it"><a href="#What-is-it" class="headerlink" title="What is it?"></a>What is it?</h2><p>Generally, code complexity is anything you introduce into your code that makes it hard to follow.  But here are a few areas you might look for code complexity.</p>
<h2 id="Do-you-have-REALLY-long-methods"><a href="#Do-you-have-REALLY-long-methods" class="headerlink" title="Do you have REALLY long methods?"></a>Do you have REALLY long methods?</h2><p>Here’s the deal.  The longer your method is, the more work it will be to keep track of the overall point of the method.  So, you want to keep the number of lines in your method low.  If you are doing too much, when you come back to your code, even you will be confused. I remember when I first started programming.  We only had 25 lines for a full screen, and the rule was, you should be able to see the full function or method on one screen full of code in your editor.  The problem with that metric now is that our screens have gotten capable of showing a lot more code.  It’s a lot like telling a new driver, he should be able to still see the license plates of the car in front of him when he stops behind a car.  Some cars exist where my tiny little Civic would be IN the other car and I’d still be able to see the plates. A better metric would be to use the 7 +/- 2 rule.  Ideally no more than 7 lines of functional code per method.  If you have to, you can fudge it to up to 9, but no more.  This is because the human brain can only deal with about 7 items at a time. I can think of a few times when you might want to break this rule, like when you have a set of conditions that really need to all be in the same place for them to make sense, but it wouldn’t hurt to try to keep to the rule as often as possible.</p>
<h2 id="Do-you-have-a-lot-of-conditions-within-one-method"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-lot-of-conditions-within-one-method" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a lot of conditions within one method?"></a><strong>Do you have a lot of conditions within one method?</strong></h2><p>When I was discussing the problem with using i, j, and k as variables, I kind of mentioned this, but I didn’t dwell on the subject a lot. You see, the story I told when I was telling you all about the i, j, and k problem violated all of the readability rules.  First, it was using the wrong variable names.  Second, the method was MUCH too long.  And third it had too many conditions. You might think that only if/else statements are conditions.  But so are for/next, while, do/while, and switch statements.  As much as you can, your code should be setup so that you only have one condition per method.  Three at the most.  Again, switch statements might loose their context, but here, I would have one method that handles the switch statement and only one line per case statement.  Each case statement should call a function that does the real work. There is a tool in Visual Studio 2013 that will help you determine how bad your methods are.  You can calculate metrics for a project or the entire solution and it will generate a table of the Cyclomatic complexity of your code.  Look for methods that have a Cyclomatic complexity of over 10 and try to bring them down.  The closer to  zero you get, the better.  Many people suggest that we keep this number below 10 or 11, but this is just an opinion.  I would rather just say look at what you’ve currently got and strive for better. If you have Visual Studio, this option is under the Analyze menu option.</p>
<h2 id="Do-you-have-a-lot-of-operations-function-calls-parameters-to-those-calls"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-lot-of-operations-function-calls-parameters-to-those-calls" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a lot of operations, function calls, parameters to those calls?"></a>Do you have a lot of operations, function calls, parameters to those calls?</h2><p>What I’m basically talking about here is what’s called Halstead Volume or Halstead Metrics.  What this computes is how complex the code is. For example, if you have five lines of code and a Cyclomatic complexity of ten as everyone suggest, your code may still be in trouble because each line of code is so complex that no one on earth could possibly understand it. We call this self obfuscating code. You probably have some superstar on your team that thinks he’s so hot that he codes an entire function on one line.  The problem with this is that six months from now, neither he nor you will be able to figure out what the code does.  Any fix that will be needed will require an entire rewrite of the code.  That’s exactly what we are trying to prevent. If you are using Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate, you can get the <a href="//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f85a7ab9-b4c2-436c-a6e5-0f06e0bac16d">Microsoft Codelens Code Health Indicator</a> which adds the ability to check for all three of the above problems for each of your methods.  If you pay attention to it, it will help you make code that is easier to understand.</p>
<h2 id="Can-You-Easily-Find-Code-You-Need-To-Maintain"><a href="#Can-You-Easily-Find-Code-You-Need-To-Maintain" class="headerlink" title="Can You Easily Find Code You Need To Maintain?"></a>Can You Easily Find Code You Need To Maintain?</h2><p>This is one that is harder to detect, but I thought I’d mention it here because it is a real issue. In an ideal world, we shouldn’t need to use a debugger to track down where the code is that we need to modify.  There are cases where this may be the only solution.  But you should know, for example, that all of your validation code is in this one location.  If you have validation code in multiple locations, you are probably thinking about your code incorrectly. But also cut yourself some slack because this kind of code complexity is not something you are going to notice until late in your project.  You may never see it, but you will certainly recognize it when you run into it in someone else’s code.</p>
<h2 id="Which-reminds-me-of-a-story"><a href="#Which-reminds-me-of-a-story" class="headerlink" title="Which reminds me of a story."></a>Which reminds me of a story.</h2><p>There was this guy that was working in a cube and he suddenly starts ranting.  “Who wrote this code?!  This is the dumbest code I’ve ever seen.  etc…”  Suddenly he got real quiet and the guy in the next cube asked him, “hey, Joe, what’s wrong?”  Joe replies, “It’s my code.” So even if you don’t pay attention to these issues for your coworker’s sake.  Do it for yourself.</p>

        <h2 id="…And-why-do-I-want-it"><a href="#…And-why-do-I-want-it" class="headerlink" title="…And why do I want it?"></a>…And why do I want it?</h2><p><img src="/uploads/2014/06/SpecFlow.png" alt="SpecFlow" title="SpecFlow">That’s what I kept asking myself every time I saw this product. Well, the last time I looked, something caught my eye enough that I decided to download it and take a look. I’m really glad I did it. So, let me attempt to explain what <a href="//www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> is.  First, while you can get SpecFlow+ Runner to run your test, this isn’t a completely new testing platform. Instead, it is a testing platform that works with whatever testing platform you are using to test your .NET code. So, it works with NUnit, MSTest, xUnit and MbUnit. This is good for my situation because any test I write with SpecFlow will continue to work with the tools I already have in place. Including my current test runners (<a href="//www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>) and my Continuous Integration system (<a href="//www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a>). I wasn’t interested in adopting a platform that wouldn’t work with these two platforms.</p>
<h2 id="Where-I-got-Confused"><a href="#Where-I-got-Confused" class="headerlink" title="Where I got Confused"></a>Where I got Confused</h2><p>Now the part that kept me from looking at this framework for such a long time was the <a href="//www.specflow.org/">home page</a>. If you go there, you will see the “Three easy steps.” 1) Specify, 2) Automate, 3) enjoy. Well, at first glance it looked like was going to have to write my test in English and then write my test in code and then I could enjoy. Why would I want to do that? So, the part they forgot to mention is that once you’ve specified your test, the Visual Studio plugin will generate your test code for you. For NUnit it actually writes the NUnit test for you. The code you do have to write is the code that translates the individual steps. But even that code gets stubbed out for you. Once you have enough of those stubbed out, to write a test, you just write the test in English, save the file, and run the test. Now that I finally understand this, I like most of what SpecFlow does. But there are a few things I wish it did differently.</p>
<h2 id="What-I-like"><a href="#What-I-like" class="headerlink" title="What I like:"></a>What I like:</h2><p>1) It puts my test in a Given, When, Then structure like I mentioned a few weeks ago. 2) The class files it generates are all partial classes. This allowed me to keep my inheritance structure that I’m dependent on for my current NUnit testing framework. And allowed me to work around one of the shortcomings I’ve found. 3) The methods are all virtual, again, allowing for extension and flexibility. 4) Intellisense is enabled so you can see similar sentences you’ve already used as you are creating new test. 5) You can create tables of parameters for test scenarios, similar to how you can pass multiple parameters to an NUnit test with the TestCase attribute or the TestCaseSource attribute. 6) To write the supporting CSharp, code I didn’t have to learn anything new. 7) I can give the English language, none code, document to the business user and they should be able to read the test well enough to tell me if the test is an accurate reflection of what they want the system to do.</p>
<h2 id="What-I-don’t-like"><a href="#What-I-don’t-like" class="headerlink" title="What I don’t like:"></a>What I don’t like:</h2><p>1) I’ve become pretty dependent on the NUnit TestFixture attribute that allows me to pass parameters to the entire test. I use this to control the testing of multiple browsers. But, I’ve recently figured out a way to run all of my browsers simultaneously rather than sequentially so I won’t need this feature in the pretty near future. Once I’ve got that working, you can be sure I’ll share it here. So, don’t forget to subscribe to this blog if you haven’t already.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2014/05/ijk.png" alt="ijk" title="ijk">One of the hardest things we do as programmers is naming things.  But the easiest thing to name is counter variables and most of us do it wrong several times a day. Of course, I’m talking about the notorious habit of naming our counter variables I, J, or K depending on how far down we’ve nested our looping. </p>
<h2 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h2><p>Now, my understanding of the history of I, J, and K as common variables that we use in programming is that the practice started in FORTRAN.  There are two reasons why FORTRAN programmers did this.  FORTRAN is primarily a math language.  I, J, and K were used in math and so the practice was carried over into FORTRAN and from there to other languages. FORTRAN encouraged this by also automatically declaring I, J and K as integers.  So using I, J and K made the code slightly easier to write and seemed to be considered a best practice at the time. The other reason I, J, and K have prevailed as indexing variables is because in the early days, our variable name length was limited and in some languages, the variable names were stored in our code and consumed memory, which was a precious resource we didn’t want to waste on long variable names. And so the practice continues to this day, largely because, “We’ve always done it that way.”</p>
<h2 id="Story"><a href="#Story" class="headerlink" title="Story"></a>Story</h2><p>But let me tell you a story that illustrates why this is a bad idea. Admittedly, this story is pretty old, but only because in my 28 years of programming, this is still the best story I have to illustrate this issue. You see, one day, back when I was still regularly programming in C++ (for you kids out there, C++ is what Java and CSharp get most of their syntax) my manager came to me with a bug. Now the interesting thing about this bug is that it only occurred with one particular data set.  Most of the time it worked. So, I put on my detective’s hat and went to work.  Now, I try to go for the quick kill first.  So, I set break points at various locations and checked variables and found out …  nothing. That’s right, nothing. After about four hours of trying various methods of the above and trying to step through the code only to find the looping that was taking place was going to cause that to take several weeks, I finally stumbled on to the problem. And I do mean I stumbled, there’s no way I was going to find this problem using any of my standard debugging techniques. Here is what the code looked like:</p>
<p>for(i = 0;i &lt; someValue;i++)<br>{<br>    // lots of code here<br>    for(j = 0;j &lt; someOtherValue;j++)<br>    {<br>        // still more code here<br>        for(k = 0;k &lt; yetAnotherValue;k++)<br>        {<br>            // and again, more code<br>            if(someConditionThatBarelyEverHappens)<br>            {<br>                for(i=0;i &lt; 3;i++)<br>                {<br>                    // some correcting code here<br>                 }<br>             }<br>            // more code<br>         }<br>        // more code<br>    }<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Do-you-see-what-I-see"><a href="#Do-you-see-what-I-see" class="headerlink" title="Do you see what I see?"></a>Do you see what I see?</h2><p>Do you see it? What was happening is that the inner “for(i…)” loop was resetting the outer I so that the whole loop essentially turned into an infinite loop for this data set. Now, this code was wrong on so many levels.  But the chief problem with the code is that by the time the original programmer for this routine got to the inner “for(i…)” loop they had forgotten that they’d already used “I” as a variable. For all I know, the guy who put the inner “for(i…)” loop in wasn’t even the same guy as the one who created the outer variable. So, how do we fix this code? Well that’s easy.  In fact, creating variable names that mean something in place of I, J, and K is one of the easiest code fixes we can implement. What is I and index of.  If you are looping through an index of bananas, call it “bananaIndex”  It isn’t rocket science.</p>
<h2 id="Challenge"><a href="#Challenge" class="headerlink" title="Challenge"></a>Challenge</h2><p>And so, my code challenge to you is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never, ever, use I, J or K (or any other single letter) as a variable name in your code.  There should be a rule in your code quality checking that just prevents this.  Even in JavaScript code.  With tools like closure compilers, there is no valid reason to use short variable names even in JavaScript.</li>
<li>When you find an existing single letter variable name, change it to something meaningful.</li>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2014/05/DRY.png" alt="DRY" title="DRY">Today I thought I’d talk to you about the programming principle known as DRY.  As you may know, DRY stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself” and it shows up in a lot more places than you might expect.  Even when you try really, really hard to not repeat yourself, you end up repeating yourself.  You repeat yourself even when you think you aren’t.  Lots of people repeat themselves.  Do you know of any? Ok.  I think you get the point.  Just like it is silly for me to repeat myself over and over again, it is silly for you to write the same code, or perform the same steps, over and over again.  To drive the point home just a little bit more.  Do you know what the acronym WET stands for?  We Enjoy Typing.  While it doesn’t capture all of what DRY is trying to combat, I think it hits about 80% of the issue.  Have you typed something that is really similar to something you already typed?</p>
<h2 id="Copy-and-Paste"><a href="#Copy-and-Paste" class="headerlink" title="Copy and Paste"></a>Copy and Paste</h2><p>The most obvious form of something that is WET is code that is an exact duplicate of something you already wrote some place else.  This can be something as mundane as code that is in the same class, to code that exist in multiple classes. In fact, I just ran into this today with some code I was working on.  The person who had written the code had created a local variable to hold a string that he was then passing into multiple methods.  That was good.  This allows us to change the string once instead of changing it in multiple places. However, he was doing the same thing in three different methods of the same class.  And in two other places he was using that same string as a string instead of using a variable. Since the string was a reference to a field name, it seemed to me to make more sense to create the variable as a constant member variable in the class and use it in all of the locations. Copy and paste issue solved. But what about the case where you need to do something similar but the code is in multiple classes?  In this case, what you’d probably want to do is to create a static class that will have a static property that will return the string.  Better yet, you could put the string in a resource file that you can reference from the static class.</p>
<h2 id="Copy-Paste-and-Modify"><a href="#Copy-Paste-and-Modify" class="headerlink" title="Copy, Paste and Modify"></a>Copy, Paste and Modify</h2><p>The most difficult area in our code to detect that our code is WETter than it should be is when we create code that we’ve done the Copy, Paste, and Modify routine to.  This is because it is similar but not exactly similar.  This is where a huge chunk of our WET code resides. So as you navigate through your code, you should be looking for code that is similar but not exactly the same and you should be asking yourself this question, “Is there any way I can merge this code so that it only appears once?” One way you might  make this kind of code DRY is by creating a method that takes parameters.  The parameters will let you pass in the stuff that is different while allowing the bulk of the code that is similar to be in one location. Another way you might deal with this problem is by creating a class with virtual functions that get called by a main method.  Then you can create child classes that have overridden methods that handle the differences in functionality.</p>
<h2 id="Similar-Steps"><a href="#Similar-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Similar Steps"></a>Similar Steps</h2><p>The hardest type of duplicate code to detect is code that has similar steps.  If you find yourself doing the same thing over and over again, you probably have an area the you either need to deal with, like we dealt with Copy, Paste, and Modify, or you may need to think about creating code that writes your code for you. This is what techniques like T4 templates were created for.</p>
<h2 id="Similar-Code-in-Different-Environments"><a href="#Similar-Code-in-Different-Environments" class="headerlink" title="Similar Code in Different Environments"></a>Similar Code in Different Environments</h2><p>One of the most natural places to deal with duplicate code is in the area of database access.  Typically we have to create tables or stored procedures in SQL, and then to access that code we need to write code in our main development language that mirrors the SQL code.  In CSharp, we create POCOs and CRUD routines.  And then if we are working on a web site, we need to mirror that code once again in JavaScript. This is a prime candidate for code that writes code.  If you don’t already have something that will do it for you, write some code that will look at your SQL and generate the code you need from that.  DRY says there should be one place that gets modified when a change to the database occurs.  That would be the database.</p>
<h2 id="Not-Just-About-Code"><a href="#Not-Just-About-Code" class="headerlink" title="Not Just About Code"></a>Not Just About Code</h2><p>But DRY isn’t just about code. There are things we do every day that have nothing to do with code that are costing us time and money.  In fact, they probably cost more time and money than your WET code because they take longer to perform. One place this occurs all of the time is in making sure that your code builds.  If you are still doing this manually, you are wasting your time.  If you aren’t doing it at all, that’s even worse.  You may not know for months that your code isn’t building and you will find out at the worst possible time.  And assuming that you have been practicing Test Driven Development, how are you making sure that those tests still work every time you make a change to your code? The obvious solution is a Continuous Integration server that reports back to you that there was a problem. What about error logs?  You are logging the errors that your system generates, right?  Are you checking the error log?  Manually?  Did you know you could setup a job to email those errors to you as soon as they occur?  No more checking needed, unless you don’t check your email.  In that case, have it send a message to your cell phone or IM you with the error, or at least have it send you a message telling you to check the log. So, those are some possible places to look for WET code.  Be on the lookout today for places that are WET and spend a little time DRYing things up.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2014/05/TDDSavesTime_AStory.png" alt="TDDSavesTime_AStory" title="TDDSavesTime_AStory">I recently had an experience writing code that proved to me, once again, that using Test Driven Development really is faster than the way I have been working. You will remember a couple of weeks ago I presented <a href="/automated-web-…tional-testing/">a strategy for creating test scenarios where we need to test storing data to a database from a web page</a>.  Well, recently, I had a chance to use that strategy.  In that article, I talked about first testing that the data that we were sending back to the server was actually coming back correctly to the web site.  By doing this, you don’t have to track down where the problem is.  Is it in the database save routine or did it not even get from the client to the server?  This part worked pretty much as expected and my code for that worked right away so I can’t say that I saved a whole lot of time. But the part that did save me a TON of time is the second half.  Saving the data to the database without having to use the web site to create the data I wanted to save. While I was testing the client side, I saved the data to a JSON string which I used to create an object that represented the data that had been sent back.  Then in my unit test, I recreated the object from the stream and sent that into my save routine.  Once the save was done, I reloaded the object from the database.  Now I have the original object and the saved object which I can compare. And the comparison showed me that the save wasn’t quite working the way I had expected.  I actually had to go through several (10? 15? 20?) iterations of fixing and testing before I got to a point where my test was succeeding.  It took about a day to get everything working.  Imagine if I were using a manual method to test this.  Launch the web site, fill out the form (it’s a pretty long form with a lot of data) save the form, reload the form, remember what I had  filled out, verify that everything got saved.  I easily saved half a day using Test Driven Development. If you are  still on the fence as to the value of implementing test prior to writing code, I would encourage you to try it.  Just try it for 30 days.  Yes, it will be hard getting started.  Yes, it will FEEL like it takes more time to write the test first.  But as you make this part of how you develop code, you will start to see for yourself how many benefits you can realize by implementing this best practice.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2014/05/TreatWarningsAsErrors.png" alt="TreatWarningsAsErrors" title="TreatWarningsAsErrors">I used to ignore warnings when I compiled my code.  Most of the time they never caused any problems and I was able to run my code.  But recently I’ve gotten pickier about my code.  One area I’ve gotten more picky about is compiler warnings. Any code that I have direct control over now compiles cleanly.  No errors and no warnings.  This past week I found a perfect example of why.  Given the following code:</p>
<p>public class Class1<br>{ public virtual int<br>        PropertyOne { get; set; } }</p>
<p>public class Class2 : Class1<br>{ public int<br>        PropertyOne { get; set; } }</p>
<p>You will get the following compiler warning: ‘VirtualShadow.Class2.PropertyOne’ hides inherited member ‘VirtualShadow.Class1.PropertyOne’. To make the current member override that implementation, add the override keyword. Otherwise add the new keyword. No big deal.  In fact, if you aren’t looking for it you won’t see it. But here is the problem. If you instantiate an object of Class2 and assign it to a variable of Class1 and then you assign the value 1 to PropertyOne using the variable of type Class1, if you tried to then access the same object from a variable of type Class2, PropertyOne will still be zero.  The default value for a property. The default implementation is to treat Class2.PropertyOne as a shadow of Class1.PropertyOne, not as an override.  The warning message is telling you that it would prefer that you be explicit about what you really want the computer to do, which you have not done. For this reason and others, I have all my projects set to treat warnings as errors in the compiler options.  It saves me from unexpected consequences like this one.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2014/04/CheckBoxGroup.png" alt="CheckBoxGroup" title="CheckBoxGroup">Today I’ve decided to post a control I created for EXTjs that might be useful to you.  The problem I was running into was that I had a group of checkbox controls that all needed to be set based on if a record exist in the database or not.  If the record is there, the box should be checked.  If it isn’t there, it shouldn’t be checked. Further, if the user checks a box, it should add a corresponding record into the database.  Since there is nothing in the current framework that deals with this situation, I decided to create a control. The config for the groupbox is the same as the config for the Ext.form.CheckboxGroup that ships with EXT 4.2 with the addition of two additional config properties, store and inputField. The store config property lets you set the store that the control is bound to just like any other control in EXT that has a store property.  It will either use the store name, or it will use the store object. The inputField config property will let you set which field in the model should be used to set the value of the checkboxes in the group. You will configure the actual check boxes under the group as you would normally.  For the purposes of binding, you will need to set the inputValue config property to the value that will make the check box true. Here’s the code:</p>
<p>Ext.define(‘framework.form.CheckboxGroup’, {<br>    extend: ‘Ext.form.CheckboxGroup’,<br>    alias: ‘widget.boundcheckboxgroup’,<br>    store: null,<br>    valueField: null,<br>    getBoxes: function(query) {<br>        return this.query(‘[isCheckbox]‘ + (query||’’));<br>    },<br>    init: function () {<br>        var self = this;<br>        self.callParent(arguments);<br>    },<br>    constructor: function (configs) {<br>        var self = this;<br>        self.callParent(arguments);<br>        self.store = configs.store;<br>        self.inputField = configs.inputField;</p>
<pre><code>    self.on(&apos;afterrender&apos;, function () {
        if (typeof self.store === &apos;string&apos;) {
            self.store = 
                Ext.data.StoreManager.get(self.store);
        }
        if (self.store !== undefined &amp;&amp; 
            self.store !== null) {
            Ext.Array.forEach(self.getBoxes(), 
                function (checkbox) {
                var record = 
                    self.store.find(self.valueField, 
                    checkbox.inputValue);
                if (record &gt; -1) {
                    checkbox.setValue(
                        checkbox.inputValue);
                }
                checkbox.on(&apos;change&apos;, 
                    function (item, newValue) {
                    record = self.store.find(

                        self.store
                            .removeAt(record);
                    }
                    if (record === -1 
                        &amp;&amp; newValue) {
                        var model = 
                            self.store.add({});
                        model\[0\].set(self.inputField,
