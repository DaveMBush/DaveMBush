<p>If you’ve been programming in any other environment than JavaScript for a while, you may be making assumptions about JavaScript Scope that just aren’t true.  One of those assumptions is how variables get evaluated when you run the JavaScript code and what variables are visible and at what point in the code they are visible.</p>
<p>Just as a test to see how well you know your JavaScript, let’s create a few tests scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="Quiz"><a href="#Quiz" class="headerlink" title="Quiz"></a>Quiz</h2><h3 id="1-Given-the-following-code"><a href="#1-Given-the-following-code" class="headerlink" title="1) Given the following code:"></a>1) Given the following code:</h3><p>var foo;<br>foo = “xyz”;</p>
<p>function bar()<br>{<br>    foo = “abc”;<br>    var foo;<br>}<br>bar();<br>console.log(foo);</p>
<p>What is displayed in the console window when console.log(foo) is executed?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<h3 id="2-Given-the-following-code"><a href="#2-Given-the-following-code" class="headerlink" title="2) Given the following code:"></a>2) Given the following code:</h3><p>var i = 20;</p>
<p>for(var i = 0;i &lt; 10;i++){<br>    console.log(i);<br>}</p>
<p>console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i);</p>
<p>What is the value of i when console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i) is executed?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<h3 id="3-What-is-wrong-with-the-following-code"><a href="#3-What-is-wrong-with-the-following-code" class="headerlink" title="3) What is wrong with the following code?"></a>3) What is wrong with the following code?</h3><p>foo();</p>
<p>var foo = function(){<br>    console.log(‘foo was called’);<br>}</p>
<h3 id="4-Why-would-changing-the-previous-code-to-this-next-block-of-code-fix-the-issue-with-the-previous-code"><a href="#4-Why-would-changing-the-previous-code-to-this-next-block-of-code-fix-the-issue-with-the-previous-code" class="headerlink" title="4) Why would changing the previous code to this next block of code fix the issue with the previous code?"></a>4) Why would changing the previous code to this next block of code fix the issue with the previous code?</h3><p>foo();</p>
<p>function foo(){<br>    console.log(‘foo was called’);<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Answers"><a href="#Answers" class="headerlink" title="Answers"></a>Answers</h2><p>1) The value of foo when console.log(foo) is executed is “xyz”</p>
<p>2) The value of i when console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i) is executed is 10</p>
<p>3) foo is declared but undefined when we try to call it on the first line</p>
<p>4) because foo is both declared and defined when it is called on the first line</p>
<h2 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h2><p>How did you do?</p>
<h2 id="1-“Hoisting”"><a href="#1-“Hoisting”" class="headerlink" title="1) “Hoisting”"></a>1) “Hoisting”</h2><p>The first thing you need to understand about how JavaScript processes code is that it goes through the block of code you are working with and processes the variable declarations first.  That is anything in the global scope (window for browsers, global for server) or anything within a function block.  From the JavaScript compiler’s perspective, the code in example 1 looks like this:</p>
<p>var foo;<br>foo = “xyz”;</p>
<p>function bar()<br>{<br>    var foo;<br>    foo = “abc”;<br>}<br>bar();<br>console.log(foo);</p>
<p>So that the foo = “abc” line assigns the string “abc” to the variable foo in the bar function’s local scope.  Not impacting the variable foo in global scope so that the result at the end of the code sample is that the foo variable still has the value “xyz”.</p>
<h2 id="2-Only-functions-and-catch-blocks-create-“block-scope”"><a href="#2-Only-functions-and-catch-blocks-create-“block-scope”" class="headerlink" title="2) Only functions and catch blocks create “block scope”"></a>2) Only functions and catch blocks create “block scope”</h2><p>In most languages that I use, if I wanted to create a variable that only had effect within a for, if, or while block, I could create a variable within the braces, or inline like in this example, and the code in the outer block would be left untouched.  But in JavaScript, this would only work if you were using the LET keyword which only appears in ECMA6 and above.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, it is perfectly legal to declare a variable multiple time.  The compiler will not complain.  So, when we run the code in example 2, the declaration within the for() is ignored and it just reuses the declaration at the beginning of the code snippet.</p>
<p>If you really wanted to declare a function within its own scope, you could create the scope with a try/catch block, like this:</p>
<p>try {throw i;}<br>catch(i){<br>    for(var i = 0;i&lt; 10;i++) {<br>        console.log(i);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i);</p>
<p>Which would give you the behavior you were probably expecting.  The code above will print out ‘final i: 20’ like you were probably expecting above.</p>
<h2 id="3-“Hoisting”-and-function-assignments"><a href="#3-“Hoisting”-and-function-assignments" class="headerlink" title="3) “Hoisting” and function assignments"></a>3) “Hoisting” and function assignments</h2><p>Going back to our discussion about variable declarations being processed first, and then doing any assignments, it becomes obvious that we can’t call a function that we haven’t assigned to the variable yet.  I don’t think I need to discuss this any further than I already have.  This works like any other variable declaration as I’ve discussed above.</p>
<h2 id="4-“Hoisting”-and-function-declarations"><a href="#4-“Hoisting”-and-function-declarations" class="headerlink" title="4) “Hoisting” and function declarations"></a>4) “Hoisting” and function declarations</h2><p>Function declarations, on the other hand, behave differently than function assignments.  In the case of function declarations, the variable AND the function that is “assigned” to it get pulled to the top of our code.  So using function declarations over function assignments is preferred simply because it assures us that the function pointer is available whenever we need it.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, maybe you thought you knew JavaScript.  Maybe you did.  Maybe you discovered you didn’t know it as well as you thought. I would encourage you to really learn the language.

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/CHIL0007.png" alt="CHIL0007" title="CHIL0007">There is a guy I’m working with who is trying to wrap his head around design principles.  He’s been watching a lot of <a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight videos</a>.  As he was processing information about <a href="/pluralsightIoC">Inversion of Control</a>, he asked the natural question I’ve never actually considered before.  “Why is it called Inversion of Control?  Normally, when you talk about ‘Inversion’ you are talking about reversing something or negating something.  That isn’t what we are doing here.” </p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Inversion-of-Control"><a href="#What-Is-Inversion-of-Control" class="headerlink" title="What Is Inversion of Control?"></a>What Is Inversion of Control?</h2><p>So, let’s start with a definition of what Inversion of Control is.  And let’s start the definition by explaining what it isn’t. In the old days, back when I started programming.  We had this thing called “Procedural Programming.” Control of your application flowed from beginning to end with looping to take care of any kind of waiting that needed to take place.  <a href="//martinfowler.com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html">Martin Fowler describes this</a> using an illustration that is version similar to a basic “How to program in C#” console application that is in the beginning of most beginner programming books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s consider a simple example. Imagine I’m writing a program to get some information from a user and I’m using a command line enquiry. I might do it something like this</p>
<p>  #ruby<br>  puts ‘What is your name?’<br>  name = gets<br>  process_name(name)<br>  puts ‘What is your quest?’<br>  quest = gets<br>  process_quest(quest)</p>
<p>In this interaction, my code is in control: it decides when to ask questions, when to read responses, and when to process those results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Inversion of Control does is that it puts something other than the main code in charge of doing critical parts of the program so that those other parts of the program can be swapped out by the person implementing the code.</p>
<h2 id="Examples-of-Inversion-of-Control"><a href="#Examples-of-Inversion-of-Control" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Inversion of Control"></a>Examples of Inversion of Control</h2><p>If you’ve ever written a WebForms or Windows Forms application, you’ve already experience inversion of control.</p>
<h3 id="OnPageLoad-or-OnFormLoad"><a href="#OnPageLoad-or-OnFormLoad" class="headerlink" title="OnPageLoad() or OnFormLoad()"></a>OnPageLoad() or OnFormLoad()</h3><p>You have probably never even given this much thought.  You think these two methods are where your code starts.  But the reality is, the code started long before these methods ever got called.  The thing that is in control is the .NET framework.  You’ve created a delegate that gets called by the framework so that your page or form does what you want it to.  Without this inversion of control, you would have to write a whole lot more code.</p>
<h3 id="Event-Handlers"><a href="#Event-Handlers" class="headerlink" title="Event Handlers"></a>Event Handlers</h3><p>While you might think of OnPageLoad and OnFormLoad as event handlers, the way they are implemented are more like virtual functions.  Event handlers, on the other hand, are a specific type of delegate that say, “When this thing happens, let me know about it.”  The code that fires the event doesn’t even really care what you do during the event.  Again, the control has been “Inverted” because there is a lot of code that is running that you have no control over and probably have no knowledge of.</p>
<h3 id="Virtual-Functions"><a href="#Virtual-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Functions"></a>Virtual Functions</h3><p>One of my favorite methods of inverting control is to use virtual functions.  I can have a parent class that controls the flow of the program that calls various virtual functions in order.  But my child class can provide the implementation of the functions to make them do various things.  I used this, at one time in the past, to create a framework for submitting links to various bookmarking sites.  They all worked essentially the same way, all I had to do was implement the specific details for each site while 80% of my code stayed the same in the base class.</p>
<h3 id="Delegates-or-Callback-Functions"><a href="#Delegates-or-Callback-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Delegates or Callback Functions"></a>Delegates or Callback Functions</h3><p>Another common way of implementing inversion is by using delegates or callbacks.  This work in a similar way to virtual functions expect that the functions are typically passed in to a method.  Much of the current implementation of JavaScript uses this method of inverting control as a primary pattern (but not limited to it as the only way.)</p>
<h3 id="Dependency-Injection"><a href="#Dependency-Injection" class="headerlink" title="Dependency Injection"></a>Dependency Injection</h3><p>I’ve <a href="/dependency-injection-not-di/">talked about Dependency Injection before</a>.  Again, it is another way of delegating control to something other than the code that has main control.  What I want to make special note of here, though, is that Inversion of Control is not Dependency Injection but Dependency Injection is a form of Inversion of Control.  I think this is where most of the confusion about Inversion of Control comes from.  Most of the literature that talks about Inversion of Control talks about it at the same time they are talking about Dependency Injection.  As though the two concepts were the same.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Inversion-of-Control-Matters"><a href="#Why-Inversion-of-Control-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Inversion of Control Matters"></a>Why Inversion of Control Matters</h2><p>Finally, I want to talk for a bit about why Inversion of Control matters.  Because, for me, it is a lot more important that we understand what we are trying to achieve than it is that we’ve given it the right name or that we even know what name to call it.  All of the examples I’ve provided are things you’ve probably done in your code.  Some of them you’ve done without even knowing you were doing them.  But think about the alternative of not doing them. First, your code would be a lot harder to maintain.  Just think of how hard it would be to write a web site and maintain it if you had to write code that handled all of the work that happens for you behind the scenes. Second, it makes the code more loosely coupled.  And by doing that, it makes the code testable AND it makes the code more flexible and easy to change in the future. Maybe instead of calling it Inversion of Control it should have been called Delegation of Control.  Either way, the concept is to remove as much code as possible from our main controlling code and give the implementation responsibility to something else that can be swapped in without having to change the main loop.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/18Tr.png" alt="SpecFlow Tutorial Session" title="18Tr">A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a post describing <a href="/setting-up-specflow/">how to setup SpecFlow</a> in which I promised to continue with how to actually use it once you have it installed.  What follows is a SpecFlow Tutorial of the tips and tricks I wish I’d known when I was starting out. </p>
<h2 id="Controlling-Associations-between-Features-and-Steps"><a href="#Controlling-Associations-between-Features-and-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Controlling Associations between Features and Steps"></a>Controlling Associations between Features and Steps</h2><p>With what you’ve learned so far, you might be able to successfully put together a set of tests for a particular page that you want to test. But as soon as you start working on the second page, you will probably discover that you have steps that seem to conflict with each other. It is at this point you will find that the ability to associate features with step files becomes critical. Fortunately, this is relatively easy. In your feature file, you will specify a category using the @category syntax and within your step file, you will use the category attribute within the step file at the class level to tie the two together. In your feature file:</p>
<p>@stepFileOne<br>Feature: SpecFlowFeature1<br>    In order to avoid silly mistakes<br>    As a math idiot<br>    I want to be told the sum of two numbers</p>
<p>And in your step file:</p>
<p>namespace SpecFlowDemos<br>{<br>    [Binding]<br>    [Category(“stepFileOne”)]<br>    public sealed class StepFileOne<br>    { …<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>Note, if you put steps in a step file that doesn’t have a category associated with it or you create a feature file that doesn’t have a category assigned to it, you’ll see all of the steps that are available. So you will want to have categories applied to everything. If you need to, you can apply categories to specific scenarios in your feature file and specific steps in your step file to gain even more control.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Repeat-Yourself-DRY"><a href="#Don’t-Repeat-Yourself-DRY" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)"></a>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</h2><h3 id="Background-section"><a href="#Background-section" class="headerlink" title="Background section"></a>Background section</h3><p>It is common to have a set of steps that repeat for each scenario. Much like a setup section in NUnit or MSTest. One of the ways you can handle this is by creating a background section.</p>
<p>Background:<br>    Given I have entered 50 into the calculator<br>    And I have entered 70 into the calculator</p>
<p>Scenario: Add two numbers<br>    When I press add<br>    Then the result should be 120 on the screen</p>
<p>The background section runs for each scenario in the feature file.</p>
<h3 id="Running-Steps-from-another-Step"><a href="#Running-Steps-from-another-Step" class="headerlink" title="Running Steps from another Step"></a>Running Steps from another Step</h3><p>You could also create a step that combines all of the common steps together and then have that step run all of the steps.</p>
<p>Scenario: Add two numbers<br>    Given the calculator has been setup<br>    When I press add<br>    Then the result should be 120 on the screen</p>
<p>  Then in your Step file, you’ll need to change your Step class to inherit from Step</p>
<p>public sealed class StepFileOne : Steps<br>{<br> …<br>}</p>
<p>And then create your step to call the other steps like this:</p>
<p>[Given(@”the calculator has been setup”)]<br>public void GivenTheCalculatorHasBeenSetup()<br>{<br>    Given(“I have entered 50 into the calculator”);<br>    Given(“I have entered 70 into the calculator”);<br>}</p>
<p>Yes, you could call the methods directly, but only if the methods are in the same class.  If you have step methods that span multiple classes, you’ll want to use this method so that you can maintain the context of the test you are running.</p>
<h3 id="Before-After-Attributes"><a href="#Before-After-Attributes" class="headerlink" title="Before/After Attributes"></a>Before/After Attributes</h3><p>Finally, you may have setup steps that really have nothing to do with the actual test. In the case of testing web pages or other applications, you’ll probably have to load the page or start up the application and wait for the page to be ready to use prior to doing anything else. And once you have completed your test, you’ll want to do some clean up. At the very least, you’ll want to close the web page. For this, SpecFlow provides the Before attribute and the After attribute. Just like the step definitions, the methods attributed with Before and After will run based on the categories they are associated with.</p>
<p>[Before]<br>public void BeforeScenario(“categoryToAssociateWith”)<br>{<br>    //TODO: implement logic that has to<br>    // run before executing each scenario<br>}</p>
<p>[After]<br>public void AfterScenario(“categoryToAssociateWith”)<br>{<br>    //TODO: implement logic that has to<br>    //run after executing each scenario<br>}</p>
<p>Other before/after attributes that you can use (from <a href="//www.specflow.org/documentation/Hooks/">//www.specflow.org/documentation/Hooks/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Attribute</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tag filtering</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>[BeforeTestRun] [AfterTestRun]</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after the entire test run_Note: As the most of the unit test runners do not provide a hook for executing logic after the test execution has been finished, the [AfterTestRun] event is triggered by the test assembly unload event. The exact timing and thread of this execution might be different for each test runner._The method it is applied to must be static.</p>
<p>[BeforeFeature] [AfterFeature]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each featureThe method it is applied to must be static.</p>
<p>[BeforeScenario] or [Before] [AfterScenario] or [After]</p>

<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario or scenario outline exampleThe short attribute names are available from v1.8.</p>
<p>[BeforeScenarioBlock] [AfterScenarioBlock]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario block (e.g. between the “givens” and the “whens”)</p>
<p>[BeforeStep] [AfterStep]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario step</p>
<p>You can annotate a single method with multiple attributes.</p>
<h2 id="Sharing-Data-Between-Step-and-Binding-Files"><a href="#Sharing-Data-Between-Step-and-Binding-Files" class="headerlink" title="Sharing Data Between Step and Binding Files"></a>Sharing Data Between Step and Binding Files</h2><p>Once you’ve setup your tests with the <code>Before</code> and <code>After</code> methods, you will probably need to save the information in a location where you can get to it while you are running the tests. You might be tempted to place this information in a member variable or a property but, if you’ve done as I’ve suggested, and placed your <code>Before</code> and <code>After</code> methods in separate files from your steps, you’ll see that this won’t make a lot of sense. Instead, what I recommend that you do is that you save the information into the <code>ScenarioContext</code> object using this syntax.</p>
<p>ScenarioContext.Current[“page”] = someValue;</p>
<p>Then, later on in your testing process, you can retrieve the value using:</p>
<p>var x = (RealObjectType)ScenarioContext.Current[“page”])</p>
<p>where “RealObjectType” is a class name that represents the type of the object that you originally stored. I typically use the Before and After scenarios to open and close the page I want to test while using Selenium. Without going into a whole lot of detail about how this works, my Before and After routine looks something like this:</p>
<p>private ISpmInitial Page<br>{<br>    get { return (ISpmInitial)(ScenarioContext.Current[“page”]); }<br>    set { ScenarioContext.Current[“page”] = value; }<br>}</p>
<p>[Before]<br>public void Before()<br>{<br>    const string id = “10039219”;<br>    var pages = new ConcurrentStack<ispminitial>();<br>    Parallel.Invoke(<br>        () => pages.Push(SpmPageFactory.GetPageModel(“FireFoxGrid”, id))<br>        ,<br>        () => pages.Push(SpmPageFactory.GetPageModel(“IE11Grid”, id))<br>    );<br>    var pagesArray = pages.ToArray();<br>    Page = new ParallelPage<ispminitial>(pagesArray).Cast();<br>}</ispminitial></ispminitial></p>
<p>[After]<br>public void After()<br>{<br>    if (Page == null) return;<br>    Page.Dispose();<br>    Page = null;<br>}</p>
<p>This code is using the Selenium parallelization code I’ve already talked about in my article, <a href="/running-selenium-in-parallel-with-any-net-unit-testing-tool/">Running Selenium In Parallel With Any .NET Unit Testing Tool</a>. The <code>Before</code> method creates my page object for the browsers I’m using. Once I have the page object, I store it into my private <code>Page</code> property which uses the <code>ScenarioContext</code> as the backing store. Then, in the step files that need access to this same page object, I create a similar <code>Page</code> property so that they can access the page object from the steps.</p>
<h2 id="Parameterized-Tests"><a href="#Parameterized-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Parameterized Tests"></a>Parameterized Tests</h2><p>It is quite common to have tests for multiple scenarios that essentially look the same except for the parameters change. Instead of using copy/paste/modify, you can create parameterized test by using the Scenario Outline directive.</p>
<p>Scenario Outline: Uses parameters<br>    Given I have entered <n1> into the calculator<br>    And I have entered <n2> into the calculator<br>    When I press <operation><br>    Then the result should be <result> on the screen</result></operation></n2></n1></p>
<pre><code>Examples: 
| n1 | n2 | operation | result |
| 1  | 2  | add       | 3      |
| 5  | 3  | subtract  | 2      |
| 5  | -3 | add       | 2      |
</code></pre><p>Keep in mind that the step that gets run is based on the merged result. So you could have multiple steps that implement any particular line in your scenario outline.</p>
<h2 id="Alternate-ways-of-structuring-your-test"><a href="#Alternate-ways-of-structuring-your-test" class="headerlink" title="Alternate ways of structuring your test"></a>Alternate ways of structuring your test</h2><h3 id="Data-Tables"><a href="#Data-Tables" class="headerlink" title="Data Tables"></a>Data Tables</h3><p>Scenario: Data Table Example<br>    Given I’ve Entered The Following Information<br>    | Field     | Value                   |<br>    | FirstName | “Dave”                  |<br>    | LastName  | “Bush”                  |<br>    | email     | “<a href="mailto:davembush@dmbcllc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">davembush@dmbcllc.com</a>“ |</p>
<p>  The first column is the names of the fields. The second column is the values. To pull the information out in the step, create, or use an existing class that has the same field names and write code similar to the following in your step.</p>
<p>class Person<br>{<br>    string FirstName { get; set; }<br>    string LastName { get; set; }<br>    string email { get; set; }<br>}</p>
<p>[Given(@”I’ve Entered The Following Information”)]<br>public void GivenIVeEnteredTheFollowingInformation(Table table)<br>{<br>    var person = table.CreateInstance<person>();<br>    // Do something with person here<br>}</person></p>
<p>You can use a horizontal layout like this:</p>
<p>Scenario: Data Table Example<br>    Given I’ve Entered The Following Information<br>    | FirstName | LastName | email                   |<br>    | “Dave”    | “Bush”   | “<a href="mailto:davembush@dmbcllc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">davembush@dmbcllc.com</a>“ |<br>    | “John”    | “Doe”    | “<a href="mailto:jdoe@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jdoe@gmail.com</a>“        |</p>
<p>In this case you use the <code>CreateSet</code> call to create a list of Person objects.</p>
<p>[Given(@”I’ve Entered The Following Information”)]<br>public void GivenIVeEnteredTheFollowingInformation<br>    (Table table)<br>{<br>    var people = table.CreateSet<person>();<br>    // Do something with people here<br>}</person></p>
<p>Finally, you may have the need to enter parameter data that is longer than will reasonably fit on one line or that needs to be on multiple lines. To do that, you delimit the beginning and end of the multi-line section with three double quotes.</p>
<p>[Given(@”I have lots of text”)]<br>public void GivenIHaveLotsOfText(string multilineText)<br>{<br>    ScenarioContext.Current.Pending();<br>}</p>
<p>The multi-line text will be passed as the last parameter in your step method. There are probably some features I missed here.  But this is already more than what I use on a day to day basis in my own SpecFlow testing scenarios.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/land-0125.jpg" alt="land-0125" title="land-0125">Way back in the day when lines were first being painted on roads.  The early lines were painted by hand.  In those days, a painter was hired and given a stretch of road to paint.  The first day he got on very well.  In fact, he was one of the best line painters they had ever had.  His lines were perfectly aligned, there were no unpainted areas in the space where there should be paint, and he managed to get 500 yards of road painted.  The average line painter normally did 250 yards in the first day.  The managers who had hired him were quite pleased.</p>
<p>Well, the next day, he came to work and set off on his task of painting the road.  He still had another 500 yards of road to paint.  And yet, for as fast as he was, he was only able to get 350 yards painted that day.  Not quite what his managers expected given his performance on the first day.  But still, better than their average painter, and so they reasoned to themselves, “Maybe he hit an extra hilly patch of road or some other unforeseen obstacle got in his way.”</p>
<p>Finally, the third day, he came in and finished the patch of road he had been given.</p>
<p>Since he had done so well on the first 1000 yards of road, management decided to put him on a job of a 1 mile stretch of road.  They also decided to make him the lead painter with a crew of 10 other painters who they had just hired.  He taught these new hires how to paint the road as he had been painting the road to date and they set off.  The first day was a great day.  They managed to get an average of 300 yards per person completed the first day.  Not quite what management had expected, but still better than the average line painter could do.</p>
<p>The next day they all came to work and continued their painting.  Yet, this time, all they were able to accomplish was 200 yards per person.</p>
<p>Predictably the next day they all came to work and continued their painting but only got 100 yards per person done.</p>
<p>Of course management got concerned and since this was a rather easy job, they couldn’t understand how the painting could keep getting slower every day.  But obviously, since they had deadlines to meet, it was time to hire some more painters.  So they added another 10 painters to the job.  This had the impact of turning the lead painter into a manager, without the pay of a manager, and in the end, it actually slowed the painting down even more because all of the painters were getting in each other’s way.</p>
<h2 id="A-Good-Idea"><a href="#A-Good-Idea" class="headerlink" title="A Good Idea"></a>A Good Idea</h2><p>One day, as they were painting, one of the painters mentioned that he had been reading that if they paired up and had one of the painters move the paint while the other painted the line and then they switched off painting or moving the paint, that the end result would be that they would actually end up completing the painting faster.  But his peer replied with several objections, the first being that they didn’t have permission to move the paint can.  If management had wanted them to move the paint can then that would have been part of the training they had received on the first day.  Others pointed out that obviously if they only had half of the people painting, it would take even longer to get the painting done.  Others were a lot more honest and just said, “I’m really not sure how we could move the paint.  The paint bucket is so heavy.</p>
<h2 id="Tell-The-Boss"><a href="#Tell-The-Boss" class="headerlink" title="Tell The Boss?"></a>Tell The Boss?</h2><p>Well, you know the type.  Guys with good ideas are hard to stop.  So at the end of the day as they were cleaning up, he mentioned to the lead painter that he had an idea that might make the job move a little faster.  What if we rigged the paint so that it could be moved along as we painted?  Then we wouldn’t have to keep walking back to the paint can.  In fact, we could pair up and have one guy move the paint while the other spent his time continuously painting.  And by switching back and forth between painting and moving paint, no one would get excessively tired doing one or the other.</p>
<p>Well, the lead painter was of course feeling threatened at this point and so he told this young up-start painter that he was hired to paint.  Not to innovate with stupid ideas that would obviously make the job take even longer.</p>
<h2 id="Quit"><a href="#Quit" class="headerlink" title="Quit"></a>Quit</h2><p>Well, now.  Not being content to keep doing things the hard way, the innovative young painter quit this crew and went to work for a new road crew who advertised themselves as “innovative, fun and open to suggestions.”  Well, I’m sure you can predict exactly what happened next.</p>
<p>The day he started on the job he found that they were painting the road exactly the same place as the last crew he worked on.  Of course, he mentioned his innovative idea, and of course, he got the same responses.</p>
<p>Frustrated, he kept moving from company to company only to find out that they nearly all had the same attitude.  And so, he decided that since at each company he was pretty well left on his own to paint the lines, it wouldn’t hurt if he rigged up a wheel barrow with some paint cans so that he could fill the paint cans from the main paint receptacle and then carry the paint to the location he was painting.  This would reduce the amount of trips back to the main paint container and it really wouldn’t disrupt the work of anyone else.</p>
<h2 id="It-Is-The-Same-Everywhere"><a href="#It-Is-The-Same-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="It Is The Same Everywhere"></a>It Is The Same Everywhere</h2><p>There was just one problem with this.  As he started out on the new job, he found that all the nay-sayers were right.  It really did slow things down.  While before he was able to get 500 yards of road done on the first day, this time he was only able to get 300 yards of road done.  He was feeling a bit discouraged, and yet convinced that if he persisted the next day would prove him right, he continued.  Sure enough, while the average painter was able to get 200 yards done on the second day, he was able to continue with 300 yards on the second day as well.  In fact, as everyone else seemed to get slower, the innovative painter was able to get 300 yards of road done every day he painted.</p>
<h2 id="The-Promotion"><a href="#The-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="The Promotion"></a>The Promotion</h2><p>Well, now he has management’s attention.  Let’s promote him.</p>
<p>Well sir, he got promoted sure enough.  You know what the first thing he tried to implement?  Yep, how about if we change our whole process to move the paint can.  Well, I’m sure you know how well that went off. </p>
<p>“We’ve been painting roads like this for 10 years and it works just fine.”</p>
<h2 id="More-Frustration"><a href="#More-Frustration" class="headerlink" title="More Frustration"></a>More Frustration</h2><p>Even with his own team, he couldn’t get the “move the paint” method of painting roads fully implemented, no matter how hard he tried.  Yeah, there were a few pockets of painters who gave it a try, but ultimately, since it felt slower than what they had always done, they fell back to the old method they knew so well.</p>
<p>And then, one day, a new painter came on the team who believed in the move the paint method.  He used  it and found another guy on the team who was willing to pair with him so that one would move the paint and the other would paint.  Wow!  The progress they made!</p>
<p>As they were working, one of them said, “I wonder if we can rig the wheelbarrow to drip the paint out so that we only have to spread it instead of having to dip the brush into the paint…</p>

  <div class="article-inner">

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’ve been asked to train a group of developers in the use of <a href="//www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> so that they can use it to write Selenium Tests.  So, in an attempt to “kill two birds with one stone” I thought today’s post would cover how to get the SpecFlow environment setup.  Not only will it help me prepare for the training session I will be leading, but it will help me when I need to set this up the next time because it tends to be a bit confusing when you setup a new project.  You’ll see why in a bit.</p>
<h2 id="Installing-SpecFlow"><a href="#Installing-SpecFlow" class="headerlink" title="Installing SpecFlow"></a>Installing SpecFlow</h2><p>The first thing you’ll want to do is to install the SpecFlow Visual Studio integration.  You do this by navigating to “Tools” –&gt; “Extension and Updates …” <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> This will bring up a dialog box where you’ll want to select the “Online” branch <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> You will notice in the upper right corner of this dialog, a search box.  Type in “SpecFlow” to find the SpecFlow extensions. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> In the image above, I’ve already installed it, so there is a check box.  You’ll want to click the “Download” or “Install” button that displays when it isn’t installed.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-a-Test-Project"><a href="#Creating-a-Test-Project" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Test Project"></a>Creating a Test Project</h2><p>Now that you’ve installed the extension, you can create a new test project.  You might expect a SpecFlow template to appear somewhere in the project list.  Sorry, that’s not what you get.  You could create one yourself if you really wanted.  To create a SpecFlow project, all you really need to do is to create a Class Library project. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image3.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Adding-a-Reference"><a href="#Adding-a-Reference" class="headerlink" title="Adding a Reference"></a>Adding a Reference</h2><p>And now, this is where I always get tripped up for a minute.  You can create a new feature file, but there is a menu item you should see that will allow you to add feature steps to a class file and you won’t see that until you add a reference to SpecFlow.  To do that, you will need to go back to NuGet.  This time use the menu option, “Tools” –&gt; “NuGet Package Manager” –&gt; “Manage NuGet Packages for Solution…” <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image4.png" alt="image" title="image"> Once again a dialog will display.  Make sure you are in the “Online” branch on the left and type “SpecFlow” into the search area in the upper right corner of the dialog. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image5.png" alt="image" title="image"> I always use SpecFlow with NUnit, if you install SpecFlow.NUnit it will automatically install the SpecFlow dependencies with it.  If you prefer to use xUnit, you can install that and the SpecFlow dependencies will install automatically.</p>
<h2 id="Create-Your-First-Feature-File"><a href="#Create-Your-First-Feature-File" class="headerlink" title="Create Your First Feature File"></a>Create Your First Feature File</h2><p>Now that you have the environment setup, you can actually use SpecFlow.  To create your first feature file, you can right click on the project and select “Add” –&gt; “New Item…” from the context menu.  Just like you would add a new file to the project any other time.  From the resulting dialog, select “SpecFlow Feature File”, give it an appropriate file name, and click the “Add” button.  When I name my SpecFlow feature files, I try to name them similar to the feature it will be testing. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image6.png" alt="image" title="image"> The resulting feature file will have a sample of how your feature will be setup.  You will want to change this to test whatever it is you are testing.  The next thing you will want to do is to create a Step Definition file.  This is a regular C# file with a Binding attribute added.  The file that SpecFlow will generate for you will match the template they provided in the feature file.  What I want you to do next is the delete all of the methods in the class so that I can show you how to add additional methods.  I’m not going to go to the trouble of showing you the screen shots.  I figure you know how to get to it and the image above shows it listed in the “Add File” dialog. Next, go back to your feature file and right click on the provided “Given” line, you should see a menu option that says, “Generate Step Definitions” <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image7.png" alt="image" title="image"> If you click this, you’ll get a dialog like this: <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image8.png" alt="image" title="image"> A couple of things you should notice.  One is the name of the class you are going to create if you click the “Generate” button.  I would advise against using the generate button.  Instead, we are going to use the “Copy methods to clipboard” method.  If you want to try to keep things segmented, you might choose to copy some of the steps to the clipboard and paste them into one file and copy others and paste them into another file.  This list will only list steps that you don’t already have definitions for, so you don’t need to worry about producing duplicate definitions. If you copy the methods onto the clipboard and paste them into the step file, you should end up with code that is functionally equivalent to what the new file template created for you.</p>
<h2 id="Just-A-Start"><a href="#Just-A-Start" class="headerlink" title="Just A Start"></a>Just A Start</h2><p>This is enough to get you setup, but there is more to cover, so make sure you subscribe to the mailing list to get notified when I post another article about SpecFlow.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/PEOP0067.png" alt="PEOP0067" title="PEOP0067">A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, we were forced to name variables and methods with very short names.  When I started my career, I was programming Clipper and C.  Clipper was a dBase compiler, so it only had 10 characters available for variable names.  You could write longer variable names if you wanted, but only the first 10 mattered.  I think at the time, C gave us 32 characters.  But now, we aren’t so limited.  And so the argument goes, if you use long variable names,  you shouldn’t need to comment your code.  I’ve argued as much. Of course every time you bring this subject up, you will inevitably find someone who will say, “But don’t we need comments to at least explain what the code was supposed to do?  After all, code is generally hard to read.”  Well, yes I guess it is if you are new to the language.  But should every foreign movie have subtitles?  Would you want native language movies to have subtitles because other people in the room might not understand it?  Must we dumb everything down to the lowest common denominator?  If so, where will it stop? </p>
<h2 id="Sometimes-Comments-Are-Needed"><a href="#Sometimes-Comments-Are-Needed" class="headerlink" title="Sometimes Comments Are Needed"></a>Sometimes Comments Are Needed</h2><p>And yet, I would argue that there are times when comments make sense.  Not so much for what you did, but for explaining why you decided to do it the way you did.  Again, you don’t always have to do this.  But there are times when I write my code that I look at it and think, “If I come back to this three months from now, I’m going to wonder what I was thinking.  I’d better add a comment to make this a bit more clear as to why this statement is here.” You see, it is the WHY that we comment.  Not the what.  The what would be described in the code itself.</p>
<h2 id="A-Perfect-World"><a href="#A-Perfect-World" class="headerlink" title="A Perfect World"></a>A Perfect World</h2><p>But this all assumes a perfect world.  And judging from the comments and blog post I’ve seen on the subject, I believe this is where the real arguments for and against code comments, have their origin. First, let’s assume for a second that you are of the persuasion that you need to comment code to tell the reader what it is you are trying to accomplish.  Where else could we put that information?</p>
<h2 id="Requirements-in-lieu-of-Comments"><a href="#Requirements-in-lieu-of-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Requirements in lieu of Comments"></a>Requirements in lieu of Comments</h2><p>Well, in a perfect world, there would be some kind of requirements document that would state that this feature was needed.  The problem is, of course, it is hard to associate the design document with the code you are writing because most design documents are really long.  Even for the most trivial of programs.  But in an Agile world, there would be some sort of back log.  A list of requirements that are broken down into small enough task that each one can be implemented as a discreet unit.  Even in an environment that is more Scrumerfall than truly Scrum, you could implement this by breaking the requirements down so they all ended up in a task list of some sort. But we still lack the ability to associate the code with the feature. Well, there are several systems available that allow you to associate task in your backlog with code you’ve checked in.   You just associate the code you are checking in with the backlog item it is associated with and the system established a two way link between the code that was changed and the backlog item that it is associated with.</p>
<h2 id="Tests-as-Comments"><a href="#Tests-as-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Tests as Comments"></a>Tests as Comments</h2><p>The next place you might associate changes with what it is you are trying to do is by creating Unit Test for the code you are writing.  The way I write my Unit Test, I have one Unit Test class per method and Given/Arrange I am testing.  Within that class I have a different test for each When/Then or Act/Assert the Given or Arrange I am trying to test.  This allows me to write my test in such a way that I know what class and method is being tested and what the test. So if I have a Class named Math that has an Add function:</p>
<p>namespace Math<br>{<br>    public class Math<br>    {<br>        public int Add(int a, int b)<br>        {<br>            return a + b;<br>        }<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>I might have a test class that looks like:</p>
<p>namespace Math.Math.Add<br>{<br>   [TestFixture]<br>    public class GivenTwoPositiveNumberAsParameters<br>    {<br>        private _math;<br>        [SetUp]<br>        public void Setup()<br>        {<br>            _math = new Math();<br>        }</p>
<pre><code>    \[Test\]
    \[TestCase(1,1)\]
    \[TestCase(5,7)\]
    public void ThenTheResultShouldBePositive(int a, int b)
    {
       Assert.That(_math.Add(a,b), Is.GreaterThan(0));
    }
}
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>Yes, I know the test itself is a weak test.  The point is the structure of the test.  I can find the tests for any one class because the test that are associated with the class are structured in such a way as to find out what the original requirement was for the test.  And so, even if I don’t have any documentation from a backlog or even from a design document.  Because of the structure of the test, it would be relatively simple to write a tool that would let you view your code and the associated test in a hyperlinked fashion so that you could easily identify the tests associated with your code and the code associated with your tests.</p>
<h2 id="TDD-as-Comments-–-A-Story"><a href="#TDD-as-Comments-–-A-Story" class="headerlink" title="TDD as Comments – A Story"></a>TDD as Comments – A Story</h2><p>Right after the dotCom crash, I ended up working for a company that had a system that they had lost the documentation for.  That is, there was no requirements document and they didn’t want to admit to the client we were working for that they had lost the document.  So, my job eventually became one of perpetual bug fixing.  And of course, since I had no idea what the system was supposed to do, I’m sure every time I fixed a bug, I introduced three more.  This was 15 years ago and I had not yet gotten TDD religion.  But looking back on it now, I see that what I could have been doing from day one is that I could have been writing unit test for each bug that came in.  Eventually, my test suite would be my documentation and there wouldn’t be any more bugs. Unlike code comments, if you are running your tests as part of a continuous integration system, you will be forced to keep your test up to date as the code changes.  Obviously, you should be updating the test, or creating new tests before you make changes, but even if you don’t, if you make a change that breaks the test, you will be forced to either fix the code so that the test succeeds or fix the test to match the new requirement. But this doesn’t really address the broader code quality issue.  At times we still need comments and they can’t be addressed by writing unit tests.  But this is why we need at least occasional paired programming and systematic code reviews.</p>
<h2 id="Code-Reviews"><a href="#Code-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="Code Reviews"></a>Code Reviews</h2><p>Several questions should be raised during code reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this code too complex?</li>
<li>Have we named things appropriately?</li>
<li>Are there any dependencies that need to be removed?</li>
<li>Are there any comments that we could add that would help a future developer maintain this code without possibly confusing him when the code changes?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve talked about a lot of these issues before so I’m not going to go into a lot of detail here other than to say that you should notice that I’ve placed the issue of code comments LAST on the list of things to consider.  This is because if you take care of the code quality, you will find that most of the time when you get to the issue of comments, no one will have anything to add.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you are working at an organization where you have no tests, you routinely deal with 1000 line methods, names of things seem arbitrary, you have no real backlog, and your code is not loosely coupled, I can see why you might think you need comments in your code.  But the problem isn’t the lack of comments.  The problem is, you are dealing with bad code.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/04/33Tr.png" alt="33Tr" title="33Tr">Several comments this week contribute to this week’s post. The first, and the one that pushed me to write this post, is a discussion over at Simple Programmer on a post called “<a href="//simpleprogrammer.com/2015/01/19/cracking-the-coding-interview/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>” where I made the following statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coding interview? Really? I wouldn’t bother. This is right up there with working 60 hour weeks for me. Yes, I know all the big companies do this, but it doesn’t make it right. “Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.” I’ve been programming now for 27 years. I started with DOS 3.1 for anyone who’s trying to figure out when that was. I’ve NEVER had to do a coding interview and I make really good money so it isn’t that I’m working for minimum wage. Here’s the deal. I can tell in about 10 minutes if another programmer knows their stuff. I expect that any company worth working for (and yes that includes even Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and the other big boys) should have someone on their staff who can do the same. The best interview I’ve ever had is from the guy I currently work under. The question was, “I know nothing about JavaScript, tell me what I need to know.” And then he just shut up and let me talk. Every once in a while, he’s ask me to drill deeper on the topic. But it is the only interview in 27 years where I felt like the guy interviewing me really wanted to know what I knew. Most of the other tech interviews I’ve been on have been more of the interviewer telling me how much he knew (by asking impossible questions). Now, if I ever did run into an interview where they wanted me to write code on a whiteboard, I’d probably pseudo code it out and explain that I’m a huge fan of Intellisense, particularly ReSharper, and Google and that I rely heavily on those two to get the syntax right. If you want a guy who can write code in notepad, I’m probably not the guy you’re looking for. If you want a guy who can solve problems, who understands how to write testable code, write unit test, can mentor younger programmers, understands what it really means to be agile, and can say “no” to power when it is appropriate, then I’m the guy you want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  OK, I admit, that probably came off a little strong.  But the point is, I don’t see any value in coding tests.  And when I interview others, what a coding test would reveal isn’t what I want to know about the interviewee and isn’t what I want to be known for.</p>
<h2 id="Response"><a href="#Response" class="headerlink" title="Response"></a>Response</h2><p>That was weeks ago.  The comment was followed up yesterday by this response</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why wouldn’t you want to have all the qualities of the latter and the ability to write code in notepad? Who says you have to be one or the other? It seems to me that most places would want to hire someone who could do both. In all my interviews, as a candidate, I’ve walked out having learned something new from a coding challenge. It’s a “free” opportunity to learn something new from someone who has different experiences and levels of understanding than I do. It’s also a good opportunity for me to recognize my knowledge gaps where I need to be stronger. Also, I think you missed out on one really critical component of white boarding code challenges. As someone who’s been on the asking questions side, I’m okay with the candidate not knowing the intricacies of array manipulation in JavaScript, but being able to have someone talk through a problem and ask questions and have a dialogue is a really important aspect for me. I really want to know how tenacious a candidate is at figuring out a problem. If they get an answer right away, we’ll move onto something else, but I want to know how willing they are to break through the wall when they don’t immediately know how to solve a problem. I also want to work with someone I enjoy solving problems with, who isn’t going to look down at their peers because they don’t have experience in time or if they have knowledge gaps. Coding challenges are an easy way to hash these things out. I’ve never made a life decision based on a 10 minute conversation and I’d hope no one would ever make a decision that could impact the next 3-5 years of my life based on a 10 minute conversation where a little extra time doing something that’s relevant and challenging could be more indicative of how I will do as a potential future team member.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Recruiter-Says"><a href="#Recruiter-Says" class="headerlink" title="Recruiter Says"></a>Recruiter Says</h2><p>And then there was this offhand comment by a recruiter this week who told me, “You know what reason most hiring managers give for refusing candidates we send them is?  ‘They aren’t dynamic enough.’  What does that even mean?” And so rather than write a whole blog post as a blog comment, I respond here.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Not-Both"><a href="#Why-Not-Both" class="headerlink" title="Why Not Both?"></a>Why Not Both?</h2><p>First, let’s get at the first question the responder asked.  Why wouldn’t I want to have all of the qualities of the later and the ability to write code in notepad? Well, it really isn’t a matter of either/or.  I think my method actually gets deeper faster.  The place I currently work interviews 10 people for every 1 we hire because most people (9 out of 10) can’t talk knowledgably about anything they have on their resumes. Once we’ve established that they aren’t lying on their resume about their experience, we can be pretty sure they’ve actually written code.  A white board coding interview might be a way of getting at this information.  I just happen to think it is inefficient at best and puts undo stress on a candidate who may otherwise be exactly what you are looking for.  In fact, you’ll notice that the comment says that the whole point of the interview is to have an interaction.  I assure you this can be done by just having a conversation about code. Second, unless you state up front that you are only looking for pseudo code and how the candidate thinks, the candidate is going to stress over syntax.  Assuming that he gets it right, it doesn’t necessarily mean that he is an efficient coder.  It only means he’s memorized a lot of syntax and can use it. The final statement is where I want to spend most of my time though.  Sorry for so much “ink” to get to the main point, but I wanted to setup the context for you.</p>
<h2 id="Decisions-Based-On-10-Minute-Conversation"><a href="#Decisions-Based-On-10-Minute-Conversation" class="headerlink" title="Decisions Based On 10 Minute Conversation"></a>Decisions Based On 10 Minute Conversation</h2><p>He states, “I’ve never made a life decision based on a 10 minute conversation …” First, I never said that an interview should only be 10 minutes long.  If the Interview only lasted 10 minutes, that would be a bad sign too.  Although, I don’t think you’d find out anything more useful by taking more than 10 minutes. Current research suggest that, no matter which method we use, most of us are hired (or hire) or not within the first 30 seconds. The rest of the time we come up with supporting reasons. (<a href="/blink">Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking</a>).  The fact of the matter is, by the time you’ve reached the coding interview, the decision has already been made.  This is just a way to justify the decision. If you were to study the psychology of sales, you would find that all of us buy based on our emotions and come up with logical reasons why after we’ve already made the decision.  This is why sales literature is aimed at the emotions.  In some way saying, “If you buy this product, you will not have to worry anymore about X”.  Sales pages are constructed the way they are based on this.  I once created a fake sales page using the formula. As much as we’d like to think otherwise, we ALL do this.  (And watch the comments come in on that statement!  Bring ‘em on.) And so we come to the final question, what do we mean by “dynamic” and how did this impact the interview.</p>
<h2 id="What-Does-“Dynamic”-Mean"><a href="#What-Does-“Dynamic”-Mean" class="headerlink" title="What Does “Dynamic” Mean?"></a>What Does “Dynamic” Mean?</h2><p>Well, I’ll tell you.  It’s like this. This week I went to a meet-up for ASP.NET and JavaScript developers.  Every person there I talked to was passionate about programming.  It was the easiest group of people I’ve ever mingled with.  Why?  Because they all wanted to talk about code.  They all had opinions.  Some I even disagree with.  But assuming they could agree to the standards at my organization, I would have hired any one of them.  Why?  Because they were “dynamic.” One guy in particular I talked to for several hours.  I knew in the first 10 minutes that he knew what he was doing.  Several hours later, I found some areas we disagreed on.  I never had to look at any code.  The way he talked about coding told me that he could code.  The projects he talked about told me that he could solve problems.  And the fact that he could explain those problems he was solving to me showed me that he could communicate.</p>
<h2 id="Cracking-The-Programmer’s-Interview-Code"><a href="#Cracking-The-Programmer’s-Interview-Code" class="headerlink" title="Cracking The Programmer’s Interview Code"></a>Cracking The Programmer’s Interview Code</h2><p>And so, to the point of the title.  The way you “Crack the Programmer’s Interview Code” is to be passionate about what you do.  Unfortunately, you can’t fake that if you don’t have a clue about programming in the first place.  Yes, you can grease the skids a bit.  Dress up for the interview.  Don’t smell.  Don’t be a jerk.  Be confident but not arrogant.  Beyond that, winning at the interview may simply be a matter of fit.  You may have to do some sort of code interview.  Or you might decide to skip it because that’s an indication to you that this place won’t be a good fit for you.  And that’s OK.  There are plenty of places to work.  You don’t have to take the first job that pays. You’ll get bonus points if you can walk into the interview already knowing what the pain points are so you can address them.  If you know what they fear, what keeps them up at night, and can show how you are the one who can solve that pain point, you are half way to getting the job. None of these are guarantees.  You may not get the job and it may have nothing to do with you.  One of the things I’m realizing is that the way people react to me has at least as much to do with them as it does with me.  If the guy is having a bad day and/or you say or do something that reminds him of something he’s associated with a bad memory, there is no way for you to know that and probably nothing you could do about it if you did.</p>

        <p>For the purposes of this post, I’m going to assume that you already have the NUnit Test Runner installed.  The question you are looking to get answered is, “How do I run NUnit from Visual Studio” or even more importantly, “How do I DEBUG NUnit test from Visual Studio”.  The following step by step should help you. Right click on the project in Solution Explorer that represents your test project. From the resulting menu, select “Properties.” In the resulting window, selec the “Debug” tab from the left-hand side of the window. <img src="/uploads/2015/04/Properties_Debug.png" alt="Properties_Debug" title="Properties_Debug"> You will want to select “Start external program” and point it to the UNnit runner that got installed when you installed NUnit. Now, whenever you run this project, with or without the debugger, NUnit will start up. Note: there is no reason to pass parameters telling it what DLL you want to run because it will load the last DLL it had up. But, if you wanted to do that, you could pass the location of the DLL as a parameter to the GUI runner. There are other parameters you can us. Check the documentation for the version of NUnit you are using for the specifics. If you are running .NET 4.x, you’ll want to go to the location in your file system where NUnit.exe lives and find the NUnit.exe.config file. Find the startup element (<startup> …. </startup>) and place this line in between the open and close startup tags:</p>
<supportedruntime version="4.0">

<p>If you miss this step, you won’t be able to debug your 4.0 code. Alternatively, you can just set your project to use .NET 3.5. So, let’s give it a try. First, put some code in the test method you just created. For our purposes, we’ll just put in a console writeline so we have somplace to put a breakpoint.</p>
<p>public void MyFirstTestMethod()<br>{<br>    Console.WriteLine(“Inside MyFirstTestMethod”);<br>}</p>
<p>Next set a breakpoint on the <code>Console.WriteLine</code> method and then run your project with the debugger. Once NUnit loads the DLL, click the “Run” button in NUnit. If everything is setup correctly, you should stop on the breakpoint you set. You may have noticed that we put several <code>Console.WriteLines()</code> in our code but they aren’t displaying anywhere.  So, where did they go?  How can we see them? By default the “Text Output” tab displays all of the <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> messages as well as all of the test results.  If all you care to see is the test results, you should select the “Errors and Failures” tab.  Personally, I prefer to work in the “Text Output” tab and I suggest that you do the same. As an alternative to this, you can just pick up a copy of <a href="/resharper">ReSharper</a>, which has an NUnit Test Runner built into it.  All you need to do to debug a test is selection the test and choose debug from the context menu.  It will save you a ton of time. Another option would be to pick up the MS Test Adapter from nunit.org.  But, I’ve never liked the way MS Test renders the tests results.  So, I don’t recommend it.  Obviously, your mileage may vary.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/04/ge-gam-018.jpg" alt="ge-gam-018" title="Test Driven Development Gamification">When I was in college, there were some guys I hung out with who played this game called “Questions” which they got from some book.  <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questions_%28game%29">Actually, it was a play</a>. Anyhow, the basic rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t answer a question with a statement</li>
<li>You can’t hesitate or make a false start</li>
<li>You can’t repeat a question that has already been used</li>
<li>You can’t ask a rhetorical question</li>
<li>You can’t ask an unrelated question.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was also <a href="//dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1111">this podcast at DotNetRocks</a> where they were talking about a beer app and how they had added game elements to the app by adding badges for various types of beer to get you out of your comfort zone.  Maybe there is one for “My first beer that I liked” because I’ve yet to find something I like.  But give me a good Merlot! All of this got me to thinking about how we might turn Test Driven Development into something of a game. There are several people who have already addressed the Gamification of TDD</p>
<h2 id="TDD-and-the-Gamification-of-Testing"><a href="#TDD-and-the-Gamification-of-Testing" class="headerlink" title="TDD and the Gamification of Testing"></a><a href="//effectivesoftwaredesign.com/2011/11/21/tdd-and-the-gamification-of-testing/">TDD and the Gamification of Testing</a></h2><p>This article talks mostly about how TDD has many elements of good gaming inherent in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it makes testing more like programming.  Well, what he actually says is that it raises testing to the level of complexity the programmer is familiar with.  But in reality, I think this is because it makes testing something that can be coded.</li>
<li>Because TDD is measurable.  The test either succeeds or fails.</li>
<li>Because TDD gives you immediate feedback.  Or at least a well written test gives you immediate feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="TDD-The-Gamification-of-Programming"><a href="#TDD-The-Gamification-of-Programming" class="headerlink" title="TDD: The Gamification of Programming"></a><a href="//benvanik.tumblr.com/post/20702406947/tdd-the-gamification-of-programming">TDD: The Gamification of Programming</a></h2><p>This article provides an interesting perspective of someone trying to program using TDD for the first time.  You get the normal complaints, like “this takes too long” along with acknowledgement of some of the benefits.  But what he realizes is that the process has made programming more like a game than about the creative problem solving most of us got in to programming for in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="Gamify-TDD"><a href="#Gamify-TDD" class="headerlink" title="Gamify TDD"></a><a href="//www.tdddev.com/2014/09/gamify-tdd.html">Gamify TDD</a></h2><p>This is the first article I found that, instead of saying that TDD is already a game, like the two above, actually ask how we might formally turn TDD into a game because it already has many elements of a game.  But he never actually says HOW he would do that.</p>
<h2 id="TDD-Gamification"><a href="#TDD-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="TDD Gamification"></a>TDD Gamification</h2><p>Putting this all together.  Here is how I would actually make TDD into a game.</p>
<h4 id="The-rules"><a href="#The-rules" class="headerlink" title="The rules:"></a>The rules:</h4><ul>
<li>The game is played in pairs.  (Paired programming)</li>
<li>Game starts when programmer 1 writes the first test.</li>
<li>Once a failing test is written, programmer 2 writes JUST ENOUGH to make the test succeed.</li>
<li>Once a test succeeds, programmer 2 writes another test, and programmer 1 writes just enough to make it succeed.</li>
<li>Play alternates until no one can think of another test that will force more code to be written.</li>
<li>Programmer loses points if he is caught writing more code than is necessary to pass the test.</li>
<li>Programmer loses points if he is caught writing code that has dependencies embedded in it.</li>
<li>If a dependency is required, the test writer and the code implementer will collaborate in the method of dependency injection to be used.</li>
<li>All points lost by one programmer go to the programmer who caught the mistake.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Embellishment"><a href="#Embellishment" class="headerlink" title="Embellishment:"></a>Embellishment:</h4><p>If code is found to have a bug in production, both programmers responsible for the code loose a point, regardless of how many lines of code are impacted.  One point per recorded bug. I’m assuming that most shops have more than 2 programmers.  On any given day, programmers would be paired up for the day of programming.  They are responsible for turning out bug free code.  Because we are tracking the code over the long term, we will be able to see just how effective each programmer is at eliminating bugs. In fact, if you are in an environment that can’t quite stomach having your programmers paired up, I would suggest keeping track of the code that wasn’t done under the game.  This would be the “house score” compared to an individual programmer’s score. The only thing we have left is some way of being able to account for productivity.  I mean, if I write no code, I’ll have no bugs, right?  And all things being equal, the more productive I am, the more bugs I’ll have.  So how do we measure this? Here is what we can’t do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines of code – you can’t measure based on lines of code because that has been shown to be an inaccurate measure of productivity.  More lines may just mean you are not very efficient.</li>
<li>Hours worked – <a href="/rapidDevelopment">Rapid Development</a> has statistics in it that show there is a factor of 10 difference between good programmers and bad programmers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Just-a-suggestion"><a href="#Just-a-suggestion" class="headerlink" title="Just a suggestion:"></a>Just a suggestion:</h4><p>Since short methods are desirable, what if we measure number of test relative to number of methods relative to number of classes.  This would enforce the single responsibility principle. T = Tests M = Methods C = Classes 1/((T/M)/C) = Productivity Score Therefore,</p>
<ul>
<li>If I worked on 3 classes each with 6 methods and each method has 2 tests, I end up with a productivity score of 1.5</li>
<li>If I had one class with 18 methods each with 2 tests, I end up with a productivity score of .5</li>
<li>If, on the other hand, I put everything in one method, and one class and had the same 36 tests, my productivity score would be .02</li>
<li>If you write no code, your productivity score is 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s just a simple way to calculate.  You may choose to use cyclomatic complexity in some way if you have that number easily available to you. Well, that’s my rough sketch of how we might be able to turn TDD into something of a game along with being able to prove to ourselves and management that it really does produce better code. How else might you embellish this or change it so it works better?  Let me know in the comments below.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/04/ppl-men-058.jpg" alt="ppl-men-058" title="Be a better programmer"> As you advance in your career, you will inevitably want to improve as a programmer.  And as you search the Internet and read various web post on the subject you will also inevitably end up with a bunch of task you should perform that will make you better. For example, if you’ve been following this blog lately, you’ll notice that I’m a big proponent of <a href="/?s=tdd">Test Driven Development</a>.  You would naturally expect me to state that to be a better programmer, you should practice Test Driven Development. There has also been a lot of emphasis recently on good basic programming principles like <a href="/dry-programming/">DRY</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29">SOLID</a>. The list could go on.  Here are a few you may be interested in experimenting with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code Reviews</li>
<li>Paired Programming</li>
<li>Learn and Implement Design Patterns</li>
<li>Reduce Method/Class Complexity</li>
<li>Practice Code Katas</li>
<li>Participate in the Community<ul>
<li>Start a Blog</li>
<li>Participate on StackOverflow</li>
<li>Read and  Comment on other people’s Blogs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And while all of these and more are good ideas, none of these ideas will actually MAKE you a better programmer.  Why?  Because becoming a better programmer is mostly about becoming a better person.</p>
<h2 id="The-Human-Side-of-Programming"><a href="#The-Human-Side-of-Programming" class="headerlink" title="The Human Side of Programming"></a>The Human Side of Programming</h2><p>You see, as much as many of use would like it to be otherwise, programming is a relational occupation.  I think, when I started, I was attracted to programming both because I liked programming and because it seemed like something I could do without too much interaction with people.  I because a consultant because I wanted to be my own boss.  But I quickly found out in both cases that in running away from relationships I was running smack in the middle of them.  We have to talk to clients to get the requirements.  We have to ask good questions.  We have to argue for what we think is right without alienating other people. And that being a consultant thing?  I found out pretty quickly that no matter what you do, there is always someone in charge.  If you have multiple clients, you have multiple bosses.  Being your own boss is a myth.  Fortunately, I like consulting for other reasons.</p>
<h2 id="Listen"><a href="#Listen" class="headerlink" title="Listen"></a>Listen</h2><p>Because programming is so relational, much of programming requires communication.  So the first thing we all need to work on is our listening skills.  Don’t go into a meeting with any preconceived idea of what the answers should be.  If you have a tendency to talk a lot, be quiet.  I’ve found that if I keep my mouth shut long enough, eventually others will say the same thing I was going to say.</p>
<h2 id="Killer-Questions"><a href="#Killer-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Killer Questions"></a>Killer Questions</h2><p>When you do talk, ask questions. I have a friend who says, “You’ll never own the answers if you don’t own the questions.”  So, don’t tell anyone anything that you can’t lead them to with questions.  Yes this takes longer but, it does two things for you. First, it makes you sound interested in what the other person thinks.  This only works, of course, if you really are interested.  The questions are just a way of helping you express the interest that you already have.  You can’t make interest a formula.  But, I would say that many people who are interested don’t sound interested because they only know how to state things. Several years ago, I learned about “<a href="//changingminds.org/techniques/questioning/socratic_questions.htm">Socratic Questioning</a>”  These questions are designed to get at the person’s thinking process.  Sometimes, just in asking the question, the person will realize they don’t know why they think what they think. I remember the gist of this by using these four questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you mean by…?</li>
<li>How do you know…?</li>
<li>What difference does it make?</li>
<li>What if you’re wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>The danger is in using these questions to win arguments.  I would suggest that instead you use them to understand where the other person is coming from.  Remember, these are questions to help you listen, not to help you win.</p>
<h2 id="“What-I-think-I-heard-you-say…”"><a href="#“What-I-think-I-heard-you-say…”" class="headerlink" title="“What I think I heard you say…”"></a>“What I think I heard you say…”</h2><p>I just learned this one recently and I’m still learning to incorporate it.  It is the follow up statement to Socratic Questioning.  This is your chance to make sure you’ve understood what the other person said by repeating what they’ve said in your own words. It is a funny thing about language, but people can use the same words and mean two entirely different things.  Have you ever had a situation where you’ve said something with absolutely no malice intended and the other person was offended?  That’s because we hear things based on our past, what happened previously in the day, and the stuff we are worrying about.  People are funny that way.</p>
<h2 id="The-Golden-Rule"><a href="#The-Golden-Rule" class="headerlink" title="The Golden Rule"></a>The Golden Rule</h2><p>OK, so everyone knows the golden rule, right? “Do unto others what you would have done to you.”  But, I’m going to put this in new terms.  “Everyone wants to be God.  Will it kill you to let them continue to think they are?” Yeah yeah, I know.  They aren’t God.  But, we all want to be.  And all conflict starts because my desire to be God is conflicting with your desire to be God.  To eliminate conflict one of us has to admit that we aren’t.  You can’t control the other person, so the only way to solve this is for you to admit that you aren’t God.  But even better if you go ahead and treat the other person like they are.</p>
<h2 id="Diet-Exercise-amp-Sleep"><a href="#Diet-Exercise-amp-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Diet, Exercise &amp; Sleep"></a>Diet, Exercise &amp; Sleep</h2><p>You may wonder what your health has to do with being a better programmer.  Especially if you don’t pay any attention to these things now.  But here are a few things I’ve noticed as I’ve started to pay more attention to my own health.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think better.</li>
<li>I’m not as tired during the day.</li>
<li>I’m not as tired at night.</li>
<li>I can get more done.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll leave exactly what that looks like to you.  But, for the curious, here is what this looks like for me.</p>
<h3 id="High-fat-low-carb-diet-HFLC"><a href="#High-fat-low-carb-diet-HFLC" class="headerlink" title="High fat, low carb diet (HFLC)."></a>High fat, low carb diet (HFLC).</h3><p>I started HFLC because I wanted to loose weight.  I was able to loose 30 pounds in a year.  But, what I found is that many of the health issues I had been experiencing were ultimately caused by the carbs I was eating.  I used to get headaches periodically that would last all day.  I guess they were migraines?  They were never diagnosed.  All I know is that I didn’t have one the whole year I was on a strict HFLC diet.  I also found out that my lactose intolerance was cured by this diet.</p>
<h3 id="Strength-Training"><a href="#Strength-Training" class="headerlink" title="Strength Training"></a>Strength Training</h3><p>One of the things I found out when I was dieting was that strength training helps burn calories even when you aren’t exercising.  So I added modest strength exercises into my routine in the morning.  John Sonmez has convinced me to add a cardio element to my routine in his book, <a href="/softSkills">Soft Skills</a>.  Since I know that my resistance to discomfort will keep me from running when it is raining, hot, or cold, I’m looking for a treadmill or an elliptical machine so I can start <a href="//www.c25k.com/">C25K</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Sleep"><a href="#Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Sleep"></a>Sleep</h3><p>Sleep has never really been an issue for me.  I was once asked, “what keeps you up at night?”  My response, “Nothing!”  Seriously, I can sleep in the middle of the living room with all kinds of stuff going on.  And while I do have particular things I “worry” about, I don’t worry about them when I’m supposed to be sleeping. But, I was finding that I was kind of sleepy during the day a lot of times.  That’s odd because I tend to get a good seven and a half hours of sleep and I’m pretty much done sleeping by the end of the time period. Then I found this app called “<a href="//www.sleepcycle.com/">Sleep Cycle</a>” that wakes you up before you fall back to sleep.  After a couple of weeks using this, along  with getting up at the same time every morning even on weekends, I’m much less likely to be dragging by the end of the day.  I find that people either love this app or hate it.  It has some other features that I don’t find very useful.  Like it tells me I had a N% good sleep.  I’ve never achieved better than 85%.  Last night it gave me a 50% score.  But in both cases, I don’t get tired until an hour before I plan to go to bed.  I’m not sure it is very accurate.  It also checks your heart rate in the morning.  But, that using the flash on the phone which bothered my wife so I’ve stopped using that.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Be-So-Critical"><a href="#Don’t-Be-So-Critical" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Be So Critical"></a>Don’t Be So Critical</h2><p>I think because we spend most of our day programming and naturally like to solve problems, we tend to come off as critical.  We probably are. Ever thought or heard things like, “The boss has no clue what he’s doing.”?  “This place would be better if…”  “If only they’d …” Here’s something to think about.  If you know so much, why don’t you start your own company? Here are a few things I’ve learned over the years.  They’ll seem obvious once I state them, but I think we forget.</p>
<h3 id="My-Boss-Has-a-Boss"><a href="#My-Boss-Has-a-Boss" class="headerlink" title="My Boss Has a  Boss"></a>My Boss Has a  Boss</h3><p>I can’t tell you how many times when I’ve actually asked my boss to explain something, the answer has been, “that’s what my boss wants”</p>
<h3 id="Everyone-Is-Doing-The-Best-They-Can"><a href="#Everyone-Is-Doing-The-Best-They-Can" class="headerlink" title="Everyone Is Doing The Best They Can"></a>Everyone Is Doing The Best They Can</h3><p>I know this may come as a shock.  But seriously, most people, while not perfect, aren’t deliberately thinking, “how can I make everyone’s life difficult today?”  Often the thing we look at as a stupid requirement or a stupid rule is because someone in the organization is trying to solve a problem and this is the best solution they could come up with.</p>
<h3 id="Everyone-Has-a-Life"><a href="#Everyone-Has-a-Life" class="headerlink" title="Everyone Has a Life"></a>Everyone Has a Life</h3><p>I think we forget, while we are at work, that everyone has a life outside of work.  The kids get sick.  Our important relationships are strained or worse.  We were abused as kids and we are trying to deal with the psychological impact that’s had on us AND hold down a job at the same time.  The real sock is that many times the person who we find difficult doesn’t even know they have issues. When ever I find someone who is difficult, I always wonder, “What history got them to be like that?” Not that we use our history as an excuse.  But I think that if we knew what was really going on, we’d be a bit more sympathetic.</p>
<h2 id="Fail"><a href="#Fail" class="headerlink" title="Fail"></a>Fail</h2><p>One of the tenets of Agile is “Fail Fast” and yet the one thing we hate to do as programmers is to fail. I used to say, “Programmers are either the most well adjusted or the craziest people in the world.  Think about it!  We spend eight hours a day in front of an inanimate object that mostly tells us that we did something wrong.  We can’t even argue about it.” But really, we tend to do what’s safe.  When is the last time you did something really risky?  As I’ve been pushing TDD on those of you who believe you can’t do TDD where you work, what I’ve really been saying is, “Take a risk, do it anyhow.” Or what about starting a blog, or speaking at a users group meeting?  There are multiple ways you can risk. If you aren’t failing, you aren’t learning.</p>
<h2 id="Smile"><a href="#Smile" class="headerlink" title="Smile"></a>Smile</h2><p>You’ll feel better and people will enjoy being with you more.  Even if you have to fake it, intentionally smile three times a day.</p>
<h2 id="Daily-Reminders"><a href="#Daily-Reminders" class="headerlink" title="Daily Reminders"></a>Daily Reminders</h2><p>Maybe you’ve heard about daily affirmations.  I’m not a big fan of affirmations.  I’ve tried them, but then my wife pointed out to me, and I’ve had it confirmed by another source, that affirmations essentially make you lie to yourself because you are stating what you want to be true as though they already are true.  This causes tension within you that makes it difficult for this to work. In, I believe it was, the 1800’s they did this thing called “Resolutions” which were statement of what you would put your effort into.  This gets a bit more to the point. But, I just call them daily reminders.  Things I want to remind myself about.  Much like affirmations and resolutions are designed to do without all of the weight. Here are some of mine so you get an example of what they look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>You feel better when you exercise</li>
<li>Exercise will make you more confident</li>
<li>What do you mean? How do you know? What difference does it make? What if you are wrong? What would you accept as evidence?</li>
<li>What are you thankful for?</li>
<li>What I think I heard you say is …</li>
<li>Carbs will eventually give you a headache and will eventually kill you.</li>
<li>Just because someone says something is true, doesn’t mean that it is.</li>
<li>How people interpret what you say and do is influenced by their own experience</li>
<li>Say “thank you” whenever it is even remotely appropriate</li>
<li>Find out what people want and give it to them (if at all possible)</li>
<li>Everyone wants to be God, treat them accordingly</li>
<li>Don’t let the perfect or the ideal be the enemy of getting started or good enough.</li>
<li>Improve by just 1%</li>
<li>Who do you want to be?</li>
<li>What is holding you back?</li>
<li>Failure is good. It is how we grow.</li>
<li>If you aren’t failing, you aren’t growing.</li>
<li>Worry about success</li>
</ul>
<p>I also have reminders on my computer screen.  Pictures or “motivational posters” that remind me of various things.  For example, I have a screen sized smiley face to remind me to smile. So there you go.  This post ended up being a lot longer than I thought it would. In what ways are you attempting to be a better programmer?  Leave me a comment and let me know.</p>
