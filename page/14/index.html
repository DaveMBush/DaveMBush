        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/04/33Tr.png" alt="33Tr" title="33Tr">Several comments this week contribute to this week’s post. The first, and the one that pushed me to write this post, is a discussion over at Simple Programmer on a post called “<a href="//simpleprogrammer.com/2015/01/19/cracking-the-coding-interview/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>” where I made the following statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coding interview? Really? I wouldn’t bother. This is right up there with working 60 hour weeks for me. Yes, I know all the big companies do this, but it doesn’t make it right. “Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.” I’ve been programming now for 27 years. I started with DOS 3.1 for anyone who’s trying to figure out when that was. I’ve NEVER had to do a coding interview and I make really good money so it isn’t that I’m working for minimum wage. Here’s the deal. I can tell in about 10 minutes if another programmer knows their stuff. I expect that any company worth working for (and yes that includes even Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and the other big boys) should have someone on their staff who can do the same. The best interview I’ve ever had is from the guy I currently work under. The question was, “I know nothing about JavaScript, tell me what I need to know.” And then he just shut up and let me talk. Every once in a while, he’s ask me to drill deeper on the topic. But it is the only interview in 27 years where I felt like the guy interviewing me really wanted to know what I knew. Most of the other tech interviews I’ve been on have been more of the interviewer telling me how much he knew (by asking impossible questions). Now, if I ever did run into an interview where they wanted me to write code on a whiteboard, I’d probably pseudo code it out and explain that I’m a huge fan of Intellisense, particularly ReSharper, and Google and that I rely heavily on those two to get the syntax right. If you want a guy who can write code in notepad, I’m probably not the guy you’re looking for. If you want a guy who can solve problems, who understands how to write testable code, write unit test, can mentor younger programmers, understands what it really means to be agile, and can say “no” to power when it is appropriate, then I’m the guy you want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  OK, I admit, that probably came off a little strong.  But the point is, I don’t see any value in coding tests.  And when I interview others, what a coding test would reveal isn’t what I want to know about the interviewee and isn’t what I want to be known for.</p>
<h2 id="Response"><a href="#Response" class="headerlink" title="Response"></a>Response</h2><p>That was weeks ago.  The comment was followed up yesterday by this response</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why wouldn’t you want to have all the qualities of the latter and the ability to write code in notepad? Who says you have to be one or the other? It seems to me that most places would want to hire someone who could do both. In all my interviews, as a candidate, I’ve walked out having learned something new from a coding challenge. It’s a “free” opportunity to learn something new from someone who has different experiences and levels of understanding than I do. It’s also a good opportunity for me to recognize my knowledge gaps where I need to be stronger. Also, I think you missed out on one really critical component of white boarding code challenges. As someone who’s been on the asking questions side, I’m okay with the candidate not knowing the intricacies of array manipulation in JavaScript, but being able to have someone talk through a problem and ask questions and have a dialogue is a really important aspect for me. I really want to know how tenacious a candidate is at figuring out a problem. If they get an answer right away, we’ll move onto something else, but I want to know how willing they are to break through the wall when they don’t immediately know how to solve a problem. I also want to work with someone I enjoy solving problems with, who isn’t going to look down at their peers because they don’t have experience in time or if they have knowledge gaps. Coding challenges are an easy way to hash these things out. I’ve never made a life decision based on a 10 minute conversation and I’d hope no one would ever make a decision that could impact the next 3-5 years of my life based on a 10 minute conversation where a little extra time doing something that’s relevant and challenging could be more indicative of how I will do as a potential future team member.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Recruiter-Says"><a href="#Recruiter-Says" class="headerlink" title="Recruiter Says"></a>Recruiter Says</h2><p>And then there was this offhand comment by a recruiter this week who told me, “You know what reason most hiring managers give for refusing candidates we send them is?  ‘They aren’t dynamic enough.’  What does that even mean?” And so rather than write a whole blog post as a blog comment, I respond here.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Not-Both"><a href="#Why-Not-Both" class="headerlink" title="Why Not Both?"></a>Why Not Both?</h2><p>First, let’s get at the first question the responder asked.  Why wouldn’t I want to have all of the qualities of the later and the ability to write code in notepad? Well, it really isn’t a matter of either/or.  I think my method actually gets deeper faster.  The place I currently work interviews 10 people for every 1 we hire because most people (9 out of 10) can’t talk knowledgably about anything they have on their resumes. Once we’ve established that they aren’t lying on their resume about their experience, we can be pretty sure they’ve actually written code.  A white board coding interview might be a way of getting at this information.  I just happen to think it is inefficient at best and puts undo stress on a candidate who may otherwise be exactly what you are looking for.  In fact, you’ll notice that the comment says that the whole point of the interview is to have an interaction.  I assure you this can be done by just having a conversation about code. Second, unless you state up front that you are only looking for pseudo code and how the candidate thinks, the candidate is going to stress over syntax.  Assuming that he gets it right, it doesn’t necessarily mean that he is an efficient coder.  It only means he’s memorized a lot of syntax and can use it. The final statement is where I want to spend most of my time though.  Sorry for so much “ink” to get to the main point, but I wanted to setup the context for you.</p>
<h2 id="Decisions-Based-On-10-Minute-Conversation"><a href="#Decisions-Based-On-10-Minute-Conversation" class="headerlink" title="Decisions Based On 10 Minute Conversation"></a>Decisions Based On 10 Minute Conversation</h2><p>He states, “I’ve never made a life decision based on a 10 minute conversation …” First, I never said that an interview should only be 10 minutes long.  If the Interview only lasted 10 minutes, that would be a bad sign too.  Although, I don’t think you’d find out anything more useful by taking more than 10 minutes. Current research suggest that, no matter which method we use, most of us are hired (or hire) or not within the first 30 seconds. The rest of the time we come up with supporting reasons. (<a href="/blink">Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking</a>).  The fact of the matter is, by the time you’ve reached the coding interview, the decision has already been made.  This is just a way to justify the decision. If you were to study the psychology of sales, you would find that all of us buy based on our emotions and come up with logical reasons why after we’ve already made the decision.  This is why sales literature is aimed at the emotions.  In some way saying, “If you buy this product, you will not have to worry anymore about X”.  Sales pages are constructed the way they are based on this.  I once created a fake sales page using the formula. As much as we’d like to think otherwise, we ALL do this.  (And watch the comments come in on that statement!  Bring ‘em on.) And so we come to the final question, what do we mean by “dynamic” and how did this impact the interview.</p>
<h2 id="What-Does-“Dynamic”-Mean"><a href="#What-Does-“Dynamic”-Mean" class="headerlink" title="What Does “Dynamic” Mean?"></a>What Does “Dynamic” Mean?</h2><p>Well, I’ll tell you.  It’s like this. This week I went to a meet-up for ASP.NET and JavaScript developers.  Every person there I talked to was passionate about programming.  It was the easiest group of people I’ve ever mingled with.  Why?  Because they all wanted to talk about code.  They all had opinions.  Some I even disagree with.  But assuming they could agree to the standards at my organization, I would have hired any one of them.  Why?  Because they were “dynamic.” One guy in particular I talked to for several hours.  I knew in the first 10 minutes that he knew what he was doing.  Several hours later, I found some areas we disagreed on.  I never had to look at any code.  The way he talked about coding told me that he could code.  The projects he talked about told me that he could solve problems.  And the fact that he could explain those problems he was solving to me showed me that he could communicate.</p>
<h2 id="Cracking-The-Programmer’s-Interview-Code"><a href="#Cracking-The-Programmer’s-Interview-Code" class="headerlink" title="Cracking The Programmer’s Interview Code"></a>Cracking The Programmer’s Interview Code</h2><p>And so, to the point of the title.  The way you “Crack the Programmer’s Interview Code” is to be passionate about what you do.  Unfortunately, you can’t fake that if you don’t have a clue about programming in the first place.  Yes, you can grease the skids a bit.  Dress up for the interview.  Don’t smell.  Don’t be a jerk.  Be confident but not arrogant.  Beyond that, winning at the interview may simply be a matter of fit.  You may have to do some sort of code interview.  Or you might decide to skip it because that’s an indication to you that this place won’t be a good fit for you.  And that’s OK.  There are plenty of places to work.  You don’t have to take the first job that pays. You’ll get bonus points if you can walk into the interview already knowing what the pain points are so you can address them.  If you know what they fear, what keeps them up at night, and can show how you are the one who can solve that pain point, you are half way to getting the job. None of these are guarantees.  You may not get the job and it may have nothing to do with you.  One of the things I’m realizing is that the way people react to me has at least as much to do with them as it does with me.  If the guy is having a bad day and/or you say or do something that reminds him of something he’s associated with a bad memory, there is no way for you to know that and probably nothing you could do about it if you did.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>For the purposes of this post, I’m going to assume that you already have the NUnit Test Runner installed.  The question you are looking to get answered is, “How do I run NUnit from Visual Studio” or even more importantly, “How do I DEBUG NUnit test from Visual Studio”.  The following step by step should help you. Right click on the project in Solution Explorer that represents your test project. From the resulting menu, select “Properties.” In the resulting window, selec the “Debug” tab from the left-hand side of the window. <img src="/uploads/2015/04/Properties_Debug.png" alt="Properties_Debug" title="Properties_Debug"> You will want to select “Start external program” and point it to the UNnit runner that got installed when you installed NUnit. Now, whenever you run this project, with or without the debugger, NUnit will start up. Note: there is no reason to pass parameters telling it what DLL you want to run because it will load the last DLL it had up. But, if you wanted to do that, you could pass the location of the DLL as a parameter to the GUI runner. There are other parameters you can us. Check the documentation for the version of NUnit you are using for the specifics. If you are running .NET 4.x, you’ll want to go to the location in your file system where NUnit.exe lives and find the NUnit.exe.config file. Find the startup element (<startup> …. </startup>) and place this line in between the open and close startup tags:</p>
<supportedruntime version="4.0">

<p>If you miss this step, you won’t be able to debug your 4.0 code. Alternatively, you can just set your project to use .NET 3.5. So, let’s give it a try. First, put some code in the test method you just created. For our purposes, we’ll just put in a console writeline so we have somplace to put a breakpoint.</p>
<p>public void MyFirstTestMethod()<br>{<br>    Console.WriteLine(“Inside MyFirstTestMethod”);<br>}</p>
<p>Next set a breakpoint on the <code>Console.WriteLine</code> method and then run your project with the debugger. Once NUnit loads the DLL, click the “Run” button in NUnit. If everything is setup correctly, you should stop on the breakpoint you set. You may have noticed that we put several <code>Console.WriteLines()</code> in our code but they aren’t displaying anywhere.  So, where did they go?  How can we see them? By default the “Text Output” tab displays all of the <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> messages as well as all of the test results.  If all you care to see is the test results, you should select the “Errors and Failures” tab.  Personally, I prefer to work in the “Text Output” tab and I suggest that you do the same. As an alternative to this, you can just pick up a copy of <a href="/resharper">ReSharper</a>, which has an NUnit Test Runner built into it.  All you need to do to debug a test is selection the test and choose debug from the context menu.  It will save you a ton of time. Another option would be to pick up the MS Test Adapter from nunit.org.  But, I’ve never liked the way MS Test renders the tests results.  So, I don’t recommend it.  Obviously, your mileage may vary.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/04/ge-gam-018.jpg" alt="ge-gam-018" title="Test Driven Development Gamification">When I was in college, there were some guys I hung out with who played this game called “Questions” which they got from some book.  <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questions_%28game%29">Actually, it was a play</a>. Anyhow, the basic rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t answer a question with a statement</li>
<li>You can’t hesitate or make a false start</li>
<li>You can’t repeat a question that has already been used</li>
<li>You can’t ask a rhetorical question</li>
<li>You can’t ask an unrelated question.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was also <a href="//dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1111">this podcast at DotNetRocks</a> where they were talking about a beer app and how they had added game elements to the app by adding badges for various types of beer to get you out of your comfort zone.  Maybe there is one for “My first beer that I liked” because I’ve yet to find something I like.  But give me a good Merlot! All of this got me to thinking about how we might turn Test Driven Development into something of a game. There are several people who have already addressed the Gamification of TDD</p>
<h2 id="TDD-and-the-Gamification-of-Testing"><a href="#TDD-and-the-Gamification-of-Testing" class="headerlink" title="TDD and the Gamification of Testing"></a><a href="//effectivesoftwaredesign.com/2011/11/21/tdd-and-the-gamification-of-testing/">TDD and the Gamification of Testing</a></h2><p>This article talks mostly about how TDD has many elements of good gaming inherent in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it makes testing more like programming.  Well, what he actually says is that it raises testing to the level of complexity the programmer is familiar with.  But in reality, I think this is because it makes testing something that can be coded.</li>
<li>Because TDD is measurable.  The test either succeeds or fails.</li>
<li>Because TDD gives you immediate feedback.  Or at least a well written test gives you immediate feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="TDD-The-Gamification-of-Programming"><a href="#TDD-The-Gamification-of-Programming" class="headerlink" title="TDD: The Gamification of Programming"></a><a href="//benvanik.tumblr.com/post/20702406947/tdd-the-gamification-of-programming">TDD: The Gamification of Programming</a></h2><p>This article provides an interesting perspective of someone trying to program using TDD for the first time.  You get the normal complaints, like “this takes too long” along with acknowledgement of some of the benefits.  But what he realizes is that the process has made programming more like a game than about the creative problem solving most of us got in to programming for in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="Gamify-TDD"><a href="#Gamify-TDD" class="headerlink" title="Gamify TDD"></a><a href="//www.tdddev.com/2014/09/gamify-tdd.html">Gamify TDD</a></h2><p>This is the first article I found that, instead of saying that TDD is already a game, like the two above, actually ask how we might formally turn TDD into a game because it already has many elements of a game.  But he never actually says HOW he would do that.</p>
<h2 id="TDD-Gamification"><a href="#TDD-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="TDD Gamification"></a>TDD Gamification</h2><p>Putting this all together.  Here is how I would actually make TDD into a game.</p>
<h4 id="The-rules"><a href="#The-rules" class="headerlink" title="The rules:"></a>The rules:</h4><ul>
<li>The game is played in pairs.  (Paired programming)</li>
<li>Game starts when programmer 1 writes the first test.</li>
<li>Once a failing test is written, programmer 2 writes JUST ENOUGH to make the test succeed.</li>
<li>Once a test succeeds, programmer 2 writes another test, and programmer 1 writes just enough to make it succeed.</li>
<li>Play alternates until no one can think of another test that will force more code to be written.</li>
<li>Programmer loses points if he is caught writing more code than is necessary to pass the test.</li>
<li>Programmer loses points if he is caught writing code that has dependencies embedded in it.</li>
<li>If a dependency is required, the test writer and the code implementer will collaborate in the method of dependency injection to be used.</li>
<li>All points lost by one programmer go to the programmer who caught the mistake.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Embellishment"><a href="#Embellishment" class="headerlink" title="Embellishment:"></a>Embellishment:</h4><p>If code is found to have a bug in production, both programmers responsible for the code loose a point, regardless of how many lines of code are impacted.  One point per recorded bug. I’m assuming that most shops have more than 2 programmers.  On any given day, programmers would be paired up for the day of programming.  They are responsible for turning out bug free code.  Because we are tracking the code over the long term, we will be able to see just how effective each programmer is at eliminating bugs. In fact, if you are in an environment that can’t quite stomach having your programmers paired up, I would suggest keeping track of the code that wasn’t done under the game.  This would be the “house score” compared to an individual programmer’s score. The only thing we have left is some way of being able to account for productivity.  I mean, if I write no code, I’ll have no bugs, right?  And all things being equal, the more productive I am, the more bugs I’ll have.  So how do we measure this? Here is what we can’t do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines of code – you can’t measure based on lines of code because that has been shown to be an inaccurate measure of productivity.  More lines may just mean you are not very efficient.</li>
<li>Hours worked – <a href="/rapidDevelopment">Rapid Development</a> has statistics in it that show there is a factor of 10 difference between good programmers and bad programmers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Just-a-suggestion"><a href="#Just-a-suggestion" class="headerlink" title="Just a suggestion:"></a>Just a suggestion:</h4><p>Since short methods are desirable, what if we measure number of test relative to number of methods relative to number of classes.  This would enforce the single responsibility principle. T = Tests M = Methods C = Classes 1/((T/M)/C) = Productivity Score Therefore,</p>
<ul>
<li>If I worked on 3 classes each with 6 methods and each method has 2 tests, I end up with a productivity score of 1.5</li>
<li>If I had one class with 18 methods each with 2 tests, I end up with a productivity score of .5</li>
<li>If, on the other hand, I put everything in one method, and one class and had the same 36 tests, my productivity score would be .02</li>
<li>If you write no code, your productivity score is 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s just a simple way to calculate.  You may choose to use cyclomatic complexity in some way if you have that number easily available to you. Well, that’s my rough sketch of how we might be able to turn TDD into something of a game along with being able to prove to ourselves and management that it really does produce better code. How else might you embellish this or change it so it works better?  Let me know in the comments below.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/04/ppl-men-058.jpg" alt="ppl-men-058" title="Be a better programmer"> As you advance in your career, you will inevitably want to improve as a programmer.  And as you search the Internet and read various web post on the subject you will also inevitably end up with a bunch of task you should perform that will make you better. For example, if you’ve been following this blog lately, you’ll notice that I’m a big proponent of <a href="/?s=tdd">Test Driven Development</a>.  You would naturally expect me to state that to be a better programmer, you should practice Test Driven Development. There has also been a lot of emphasis recently on good basic programming principles like <a href="/dry-programming/">DRY</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29">SOLID</a>. The list could go on.  Here are a few you may be interested in experimenting with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code Reviews</li>
<li>Paired Programming</li>
<li>Learn and Implement Design Patterns</li>
<li>Reduce Method/Class Complexity</li>
<li>Practice Code Katas</li>
<li>Participate in the Community<ul>
<li>Start a Blog</li>
<li>Participate on StackOverflow</li>
<li>Read and  Comment on other people’s Blogs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And while all of these and more are good ideas, none of these ideas will actually MAKE you a better programmer.  Why?  Because becoming a better programmer is mostly about becoming a better person.</p>
<h2 id="The-Human-Side-of-Programming"><a href="#The-Human-Side-of-Programming" class="headerlink" title="The Human Side of Programming"></a>The Human Side of Programming</h2><p>You see, as much as many of use would like it to be otherwise, programming is a relational occupation.  I think, when I started, I was attracted to programming both because I liked programming and because it seemed like something I could do without too much interaction with people.  I because a consultant because I wanted to be my own boss.  But I quickly found out in both cases that in running away from relationships I was running smack in the middle of them.  We have to talk to clients to get the requirements.  We have to ask good questions.  We have to argue for what we think is right without alienating other people. And that being a consultant thing?  I found out pretty quickly that no matter what you do, there is always someone in charge.  If you have multiple clients, you have multiple bosses.  Being your own boss is a myth.  Fortunately, I like consulting for other reasons.</p>
<h2 id="Listen"><a href="#Listen" class="headerlink" title="Listen"></a>Listen</h2><p>Because programming is so relational, much of programming requires communication.  So the first thing we all need to work on is our listening skills.  Don’t go into a meeting with any preconceived idea of what the answers should be.  If you have a tendency to talk a lot, be quiet.  I’ve found that if I keep my mouth shut long enough, eventually others will say the same thing I was going to say.</p>
<h2 id="Killer-Questions"><a href="#Killer-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Killer Questions"></a>Killer Questions</h2><p>When you do talk, ask questions. I have a friend who says, “You’ll never own the answers if you don’t own the questions.”  So, don’t tell anyone anything that you can’t lead them to with questions.  Yes this takes longer but, it does two things for you. First, it makes you sound interested in what the other person thinks.  This only works, of course, if you really are interested.  The questions are just a way of helping you express the interest that you already have.  You can’t make interest a formula.  But, I would say that many people who are interested don’t sound interested because they only know how to state things. Several years ago, I learned about “<a href="//changingminds.org/techniques/questioning/socratic_questions.htm">Socratic Questioning</a>”  These questions are designed to get at the person’s thinking process.  Sometimes, just in asking the question, the person will realize they don’t know why they think what they think. I remember the gist of this by using these four questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you mean by…?</li>
<li>How do you know…?</li>
<li>What difference does it make?</li>
<li>What if you’re wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>The danger is in using these questions to win arguments.  I would suggest that instead you use them to understand where the other person is coming from.  Remember, these are questions to help you listen, not to help you win.</p>
<h2 id="“What-I-think-I-heard-you-say…”"><a href="#“What-I-think-I-heard-you-say…”" class="headerlink" title="“What I think I heard you say…”"></a>“What I think I heard you say…”</h2><p>I just learned this one recently and I’m still learning to incorporate it.  It is the follow up statement to Socratic Questioning.  This is your chance to make sure you’ve understood what the other person said by repeating what they’ve said in your own words. It is a funny thing about language, but people can use the same words and mean two entirely different things.  Have you ever had a situation where you’ve said something with absolutely no malice intended and the other person was offended?  That’s because we hear things based on our past, what happened previously in the day, and the stuff we are worrying about.  People are funny that way.</p>
<h2 id="The-Golden-Rule"><a href="#The-Golden-Rule" class="headerlink" title="The Golden Rule"></a>The Golden Rule</h2><p>OK, so everyone knows the golden rule, right? “Do unto others what you would have done to you.”  But, I’m going to put this in new terms.  “Everyone wants to be God.  Will it kill you to let them continue to think they are?” Yeah yeah, I know.  They aren’t God.  But, we all want to be.  And all conflict starts because my desire to be God is conflicting with your desire to be God.  To eliminate conflict one of us has to admit that we aren’t.  You can’t control the other person, so the only way to solve this is for you to admit that you aren’t God.  But even better if you go ahead and treat the other person like they are.</p>
<h2 id="Diet-Exercise-amp-Sleep"><a href="#Diet-Exercise-amp-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Diet, Exercise &amp; Sleep"></a>Diet, Exercise &amp; Sleep</h2><p>You may wonder what your health has to do with being a better programmer.  Especially if you don’t pay any attention to these things now.  But here are a few things I’ve noticed as I’ve started to pay more attention to my own health.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think better.</li>
<li>I’m not as tired during the day.</li>
<li>I’m not as tired at night.</li>
<li>I can get more done.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll leave exactly what that looks like to you.  But, for the curious, here is what this looks like for me.</p>
<h3 id="High-fat-low-carb-diet-HFLC"><a href="#High-fat-low-carb-diet-HFLC" class="headerlink" title="High fat, low carb diet (HFLC)."></a>High fat, low carb diet (HFLC).</h3><p>I started HFLC because I wanted to loose weight.  I was able to loose 30 pounds in a year.  But, what I found is that many of the health issues I had been experiencing were ultimately caused by the carbs I was eating.  I used to get headaches periodically that would last all day.  I guess they were migraines?  They were never diagnosed.  All I know is that I didn’t have one the whole year I was on a strict HFLC diet.  I also found out that my lactose intolerance was cured by this diet.</p>
<h3 id="Strength-Training"><a href="#Strength-Training" class="headerlink" title="Strength Training"></a>Strength Training</h3><p>One of the things I found out when I was dieting was that strength training helps burn calories even when you aren’t exercising.  So I added modest strength exercises into my routine in the morning.  John Sonmez has convinced me to add a cardio element to my routine in his book, <a href="/softSkills">Soft Skills</a>.  Since I know that my resistance to discomfort will keep me from running when it is raining, hot, or cold, I’m looking for a treadmill or an elliptical machine so I can start <a href="//www.c25k.com/">C25K</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Sleep"><a href="#Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Sleep"></a>Sleep</h3><p>Sleep has never really been an issue for me.  I was once asked, “what keeps you up at night?”  My response, “Nothing!”  Seriously, I can sleep in the middle of the living room with all kinds of stuff going on.  And while I do have particular things I “worry” about, I don’t worry about them when I’m supposed to be sleeping. But, I was finding that I was kind of sleepy during the day a lot of times.  That’s odd because I tend to get a good seven and a half hours of sleep and I’m pretty much done sleeping by the end of the time period. Then I found this app called “<a href="//www.sleepcycle.com/">Sleep Cycle</a>” that wakes you up before you fall back to sleep.  After a couple of weeks using this, along  with getting up at the same time every morning even on weekends, I’m much less likely to be dragging by the end of the day.  I find that people either love this app or hate it.  It has some other features that I don’t find very useful.  Like it tells me I had a N% good sleep.  I’ve never achieved better than 85%.  Last night it gave me a 50% score.  But in both cases, I don’t get tired until an hour before I plan to go to bed.  I’m not sure it is very accurate.  It also checks your heart rate in the morning.  But, that using the flash on the phone which bothered my wife so I’ve stopped using that.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Be-So-Critical"><a href="#Don’t-Be-So-Critical" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Be So Critical"></a>Don’t Be So Critical</h2><p>I think because we spend most of our day programming and naturally like to solve problems, we tend to come off as critical.  We probably are. Ever thought or heard things like, “The boss has no clue what he’s doing.”?  “This place would be better if…”  “If only they’d …” Here’s something to think about.  If you know so much, why don’t you start your own company? Here are a few things I’ve learned over the years.  They’ll seem obvious once I state them, but I think we forget.</p>
<h3 id="My-Boss-Has-a-Boss"><a href="#My-Boss-Has-a-Boss" class="headerlink" title="My Boss Has a  Boss"></a>My Boss Has a  Boss</h3><p>I can’t tell you how many times when I’ve actually asked my boss to explain something, the answer has been, “that’s what my boss wants”</p>
<h3 id="Everyone-Is-Doing-The-Best-They-Can"><a href="#Everyone-Is-Doing-The-Best-They-Can" class="headerlink" title="Everyone Is Doing The Best They Can"></a>Everyone Is Doing The Best They Can</h3><p>I know this may come as a shock.  But seriously, most people, while not perfect, aren’t deliberately thinking, “how can I make everyone’s life difficult today?”  Often the thing we look at as a stupid requirement or a stupid rule is because someone in the organization is trying to solve a problem and this is the best solution they could come up with.</p>
<h3 id="Everyone-Has-a-Life"><a href="#Everyone-Has-a-Life" class="headerlink" title="Everyone Has a Life"></a>Everyone Has a Life</h3><p>I think we forget, while we are at work, that everyone has a life outside of work.  The kids get sick.  Our important relationships are strained or worse.  We were abused as kids and we are trying to deal with the psychological impact that’s had on us AND hold down a job at the same time.  The real sock is that many times the person who we find difficult doesn’t even know they have issues. When ever I find someone who is difficult, I always wonder, “What history got them to be like that?” Not that we use our history as an excuse.  But I think that if we knew what was really going on, we’d be a bit more sympathetic.</p>
<h2 id="Fail"><a href="#Fail" class="headerlink" title="Fail"></a>Fail</h2><p>One of the tenets of Agile is “Fail Fast” and yet the one thing we hate to do as programmers is to fail. I used to say, “Programmers are either the most well adjusted or the craziest people in the world.  Think about it!  We spend eight hours a day in front of an inanimate object that mostly tells us that we did something wrong.  We can’t even argue about it.” But really, we tend to do what’s safe.  When is the last time you did something really risky?  As I’ve been pushing TDD on those of you who believe you can’t do TDD where you work, what I’ve really been saying is, “Take a risk, do it anyhow.” Or what about starting a blog, or speaking at a users group meeting?  There are multiple ways you can risk. If you aren’t failing, you aren’t learning.</p>
<h2 id="Smile"><a href="#Smile" class="headerlink" title="Smile"></a>Smile</h2><p>You’ll feel better and people will enjoy being with you more.  Even if you have to fake it, intentionally smile three times a day.</p>
<h2 id="Daily-Reminders"><a href="#Daily-Reminders" class="headerlink" title="Daily Reminders"></a>Daily Reminders</h2><p>Maybe you’ve heard about daily affirmations.  I’m not a big fan of affirmations.  I’ve tried them, but then my wife pointed out to me, and I’ve had it confirmed by another source, that affirmations essentially make you lie to yourself because you are stating what you want to be true as though they already are true.  This causes tension within you that makes it difficult for this to work. In, I believe it was, the 1800’s they did this thing called “Resolutions” which were statement of what you would put your effort into.  This gets a bit more to the point. But, I just call them daily reminders.  Things I want to remind myself about.  Much like affirmations and resolutions are designed to do without all of the weight. Here are some of mine so you get an example of what they look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>You feel better when you exercise</li>
<li>Exercise will make you more confident</li>
<li>What do you mean? How do you know? What difference does it make? What if you are wrong? What would you accept as evidence?</li>
<li>What are you thankful for?</li>
<li>What I think I heard you say is …</li>
<li>Carbs will eventually give you a headache and will eventually kill you.</li>
<li>Just because someone says something is true, doesn’t mean that it is.</li>
<li>How people interpret what you say and do is influenced by their own experience</li>
<li>Say “thank you” whenever it is even remotely appropriate</li>
<li>Find out what people want and give it to them (if at all possible)</li>
<li>Everyone wants to be God, treat them accordingly</li>
<li>Don’t let the perfect or the ideal be the enemy of getting started or good enough.</li>
<li>Improve by just 1%</li>
<li>Who do you want to be?</li>
<li>What is holding you back?</li>
<li>Failure is good. It is how we grow.</li>
<li>If you aren’t failing, you aren’t growing.</li>
<li>Worry about success</li>
</ul>
<p>I also have reminders on my computer screen.  Pictures or “motivational posters” that remind me of various things.  For example, I have a screen sized smiley face to remind me to smile. So there you go.  This post ended up being a lot longer than I thought it would. In what ways are you attempting to be a better programmer?  Leave me a comment and let me know.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/03/ppl-men-026.jpg" alt="scream" title="scream">At the risk of making half of my audience think I’ve gone off the deep end, I’m going to address a topic that I’ve only recently REALLY begun to understand, in part thanks to <a href="/softSkills">Soft Skills</a>. When I’ve heard the topic of “Limiting Beliefs” come up, it has almost always been in the context of something along the lines of “What the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”  Which is easy to disprove.  At least it is out of context!  I mean really, if I can conceive and believe myself to be a butterfly, it just isn’t going to happen! However, the opposite is pretty easy to both accept and believe.  And that’s what I want to talk about today.  But even then, it probably isn’t what you are expecting. Typically, when people talk about Limiting Beliefs, they are talking about patterns and practices you picked up as a kid that are holding you back now.  And while those may be areas that you need to work on, what I want to talk about today is more micro than that, although they may have roots in our past for various reasons, the Limiting Beliefs I want to talk about today are common across nearly every programmer I talk to.  If you think “Limiting Beliefs” mean something along the lines of, “you are limited because you don’t believe enough,” that is NOT what I have in mind here at all.  In fact, “Limiting Beliefs” are beliefs that we believe TOO strongly and because we hold them too strongly, they limit us.  This is what I mean when I talk about “Limiting Beliefs” even if it is used in another way by someone else. Here are some examples specifically related to the craft of programming.</p>
<h2 id="You-Can’t-Practice-TDD"><a href="#You-Can’t-Practice-TDD" class="headerlink" title="You Can’t Practice TDD"></a>You Can’t Practice TDD</h2><p>As I’ve mentioned in other articles, most programmers I know don’t practice Test Driven Development because they believe they don’t have permission.  And when they ask, they don’t get permission because you’ve transferred the belief that you don’t think it is important. If instead, you believed you had permission to do whatever it took to legitimately do your job well, you would learn how to do everything it took to practice TDD well.</p>
<h2 id="Can’t-Create-Branches-in-Version-Control"><a href="#Can’t-Create-Branches-in-Version-Control" class="headerlink" title="Can’t Create Branches in Version Control"></a>Can’t Create Branches in Version Control</h2><p>I recently ran into a comment on a blog that mention this.  In fact I’ve run into this very issue where I am currently working.  But instead of thinking about what I can’t do, or when I am frustrated by what I can’t do, I first think 1) is this important enough to find a way around? And 2) what CAN I do? In this case, I found it critically important.  My productivity was being hampered because I am adding new features to existing code and, while that code is being tested, I’m converting the code to the last version of the library that we use.  Branching allows me to switch between the two projects easily and it allows me to migrate the current code into the upgrade code so that when the conversion is done, I can merge it down into the main branch and keep going. How did I do this?  We use TFS with the old TFVS version control system instead of the Git repository.  But there are at least two projects that exist that allow you to create a bridge between your local code that uses a local GIT repository and the remote TFS repository.  There is at least one project available for subversion that allows you to do the same sort of thing. I get my branches and yet I have not caused any disruption to the rest of my team.</p>
<h2 id="Can’t-Use-X-Technology"><a href="#Can’t-Use-X-Technology" class="headerlink" title="Can’t Use X Technology"></a>Can’t Use X Technology</h2><p>OK.  So, again, ask yourself the same questions.  Is this hampering your productivity?  What CAN you do?</p>
<h2 id="You-Have-to-be-Perfect"><a href="#You-Have-to-be-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="You Have to be Perfect"></a>You Have to be Perfect</h2><p>I think many of us realize that we can’t be perfect and yet, how do you react when someone finds a bug in your code? I saw a tweet last week that captures the essence of the bug fixing process.</p>
<ol>
<li>That can’t happen</li>
<li>That doesn’t happen on my machine.</li>
<li>That shouldn’t happen.</li>
<li>Why does that happen?</li>
<li>Oh, I see.</li>
<li>How did that ever work?</li>
</ol>
<p>The question I need to ask is, why do we start with “That can’t happen” unless we feel that we need to be perfect. In the last year, I’ve finally gotten to the point where my first reaction is, “OK, well, put it in the issue tracker.” (Or if you are doing Agile, “put it in the backlog”).</p>
<h2 id="Can’t-Practice-Agile-Scrum"><a href="#Can’t-Practice-Agile-Scrum" class="headerlink" title="Can’t Practice Agile/Scrum"></a>Can’t Practice Agile/Scrum</h2><p>Speaking of Agile/Scrum.  Are you working at a place that doesn’t practice Agile or Scrum, but you think they should?  What parts of Agile/Scrum can you implement in the sphere of influence you have?  So, you can’t form a Scrum team.  But, do you personally put people over processes?  Do you put people first at all?  Most of the <a href="//agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> can be implemented at a personal level once you understand what it is really about.  Don’t expect anyone to adopt agile in your organization if they don’t see it in you first.</p>
<h2 id="You-Are-an-Introvert"><a href="#You-Are-an-Introvert" class="headerlink" title="You Are an Introvert"></a>You Are an Introvert</h2><p>How many of us hide behind this one?  We don’t want to deal with people.  We really don’t value people over much of anything.  In fact, we think, “programming would be a great job if it weren’t for the clients.”  I’m reading some books that talk about the impact of confusing behavior with who we are.  OK, so sure, your behavior is that you prefer to avoid loud noises.  You’d rather talk to one or two people at a time.  You process stuff in your head instead of with your mouth.  That’s behavior.  To say, “I am an Introvert” can have the effect of saying, “I hate people” and can become a limiting belief because it will isolate you from the very people you should be helping.  Sorry, you can’t get far as a programmer if you avoid the people part of it.</p>
<h2 id="Restrictions"><a href="#Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Restrictions"></a>Restrictions</h2><p>And then there is the general set of restrictions that come with being part of any organization.  We have a few where I work that, on the face of it, seem ridiculous.  I HAVE to take a lunch break even though my lunch consist of 5 sausage links that can be consumed in about 5 minutes.  I can’t start before 7am.  I can’t leave until 3:30. But what can I do?  Well, no one said WHEN I had to take the lunch break, so I come in and watch a half hour of <a href="/pluralSight">PluralSight</a> courses every morning. I can’t start before 7am.  But I CAN enter the office before then.  I prefer to come earlier because the traffic is lighter if I come in at 6:45.  So, I come in and don’t start working until seven. To get my eight hours in, I can’t leave until 3:30 anyhow.  So that is not an issue.  And if I need to leave early occasionally, no one said I couldn’t do that.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/03/NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList.png" alt="NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList" title="NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList">Several weeks ago now, I started learning <a href="//nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>.  Why?  Well, for a couple of reasons.  First, all the cool kids are using Node.js.  Second, I wanted to use <a href="//gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/">Istanbul</a> to get an idea of how well my javascript code is covered by test and that runs under Node.js.  Third, <a href="//blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2015/03/19/customize-external-web-tools-in-visual-studio-2015.aspx">Node.js is going to show up in the next version of Visual Studio</a>.  And finally, I just like to learn new stuff.</p>
<h2 id="Node-JS"><a href="#Node-JS" class="headerlink" title="Node.JS"></a>Node.JS</h2><p>So, I started by installing node and just working in Visual Studio as though my node project was a web site.  It works, but it isn’t pretty.  But it did get me familiar with some basic concepts like using the node package manager (npm) to install what I needed to get Istanbul running.  For those of you who aren’t familiar with npm, it is basically NuGet for node.js.</p>
<h2 id="Istanbul-JavaScript-Code-Coverage"><a href="#Istanbul-JavaScript-Code-Coverage" class="headerlink" title="Istanbul JavaScript Code Coverage"></a>Istanbul JavaScript Code Coverage</h2><p>For those of you who are interested, I used the instructions <a href="//ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/10/code-coverage-of-jasmine-tests-using-istanbul-and-karma.html">here</a> for getting Istanbul working locally.  They should probably be updated because the example there doesn’t have a good configuration example.  I filled in the rest of what I needed to know from the <a href="//karma-runner.github.io/0.12/">Karma site</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Node-for-Visual-Studio"><a href="#Node-for-Visual-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Node for Visual Studio"></a>Node for Visual Studio</h2><p>So then I had heard that work was being done on a plugin for Visual Studio 2013 that would allow me to work on Node projects from within Visual Studio.  I found out about this first from <a href="//www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingNodejsToolsForVisualStudio.aspx">Scott Hanselman’s blog</a>. So I went  to the <a href="//nodejstools.codeplex.com/">plugin site</a> and got the download and installed it.  This is all pretty straight forward.  Don’t forget, you’ll ALSO need to install node.  So, don’t forget that step. OK.  Now that you have the NTVS installed (that’s what they call the plugin) what do you have? Well, you have several new project templates that you can use.  That’s what. <img src="/uploads/2015/03/NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList1.png" alt="NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList" title="NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList"></p>
<h2 id="Interactive-JavaScript"><a href="#Interactive-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Interactive JavaScript"></a>Interactive JavaScript</h2><p>But that’s not all you get, you also get an interactive Node.js window that you can get to from the Tools menu (Tools –&gt; Node.js Tools –&gt; Node.js Interactive window) or by pressing  the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+K, N.  Inside this window you can execute JavaScript on the fly: <img src="/uploads/2015/03/NodeJsInteractiveWindow.png" alt="NodeJsInteractiveWindow" title="NodeJsInteractiveWindow"></p>
<h2 id="Node-Package-Manager-in-Visual-Studio"><a href="#Node-Package-Manager-in-Visual-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Node Package Manager in Visual Studio"></a>Node Package Manager in Visual Studio</h2><p>Or install other node packages:</p>
<p>.npm install yourPackageNameHere</p>
<p>Don’t forget the leading period.  That’s the indication to the window that it needs to do something different than executing javascript in the window. Even as I’m writing this, I’m seeing that there is a whole lot more here than I’m actually telling you now.</p>
<h2 id="Starting-a-New-Project"><a href="#Starting-a-New-Project" class="headerlink" title="Starting a New Project"></a>Starting a New Project</h2><p>Now, the best way of learning something is by creating some kind of product.  Even if it is for your own use.  So, the next thing I did was to try to create a project.  I have a specific project in mind that should use MongoDB for the database (I’ve been meaning to learn NoSQL for a while now) and since Express seems to come with NTVS, I guess I’ll use that for my web server.  Oh and Angular for the front end. Since I was creating a web site, I thought, I should create a new web project that uses node.  In fact, it shows up  in the list of web sites types that you can create.  However, I got an error when I did that, and I don’t see anything in the documentation that says I should be able to use those templates or that I need anything extra to use them. However, if you use the project options, you can create a web application.  I decided going with newer is better than older, so I’ve created a “Basic Node.js Express 4 Application”.</p>
<h2 id="The-Fun-Is-Just-Beginning"><a href="#The-Fun-Is-Just-Beginning" class="headerlink" title="The Fun Is Just Beginning"></a>The Fun Is Just Beginning</h2><p>And now, this is where the fun begins.  Where’s my HTML?  What’s all this “template” stuff?  And how do I install Angular?  Or do I do that manually since it isn’t a server side thing? So much to learn.  But, that’s for another post.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/03/iStock_000005626017Medium1.jpg" alt="100% code coverage" title="100% Code Coverage"></p>
<p>In response to my post “<a href="/excuses-for-not-testing/">Excuses For Not Testing</a>” <a href="//disqus.com/by/mayofcherries/">Kris K</a> asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also another side of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" title="Unit testing">Unit Tests</a>. Some companies are so fixated they aspire to have 100% Unit Tests coverage and they make programmers write Unit Tests for legacy code for no reason. Just for the sake of having Unit Tests. … [I] wonder if you had any similar experiences and what you think about this approach. I guess the 100% extreme is better than no tests at all, but it can make the developers very bored and feeling useless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And my initial reaction to this was, “WOW!  So much to respond to here.  I think this is worth a blog post.</p>
<h2 id="Is-100-realistic"><a href="#Is-100-realistic" class="headerlink" title="Is 100% realistic?"></a>Is 100% realistic?</h2><p>So, first, the question of 100% coverage.  Is that a realistic goal?  And the answer of course is, “it depends.”</p>
<h4 id="The-first-dependency-is-of-course-“what-do-you-mean-by-‘100-code-coverage’-”"><a href="#The-first-dependency-is-of-course-“what-do-you-mean-by-‘100-code-coverage’-”" class="headerlink" title="The first dependency is, of course, “what do you mean by ‘100% code coverage’?”"></a>The first dependency is, of course, “what do you mean by ‘100% <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage" title="Code coverage">code coverage</a>’?”</h4><p>Do you mean you need tests for not just all of the code you wrote, but all of the code your tools wrote for you and all of your third party libraries?  If 100% is inclusive, I’d lean toward 100% not only being not realistic, but also not necessary. Although, in a highly critical system, you’ll probably want to do some kind of vetting of the tools and libraries you are using.  But by the time you are using them, you should already know that they work, the only thing you won’t know for sure is if you are using them correctly.  In this case, you are looking at integration tests and not unit tests.</p>
<h4 id="The-second-dependency-is-“Is-the-code-testable-”"><a href="#The-second-dependency-is-“Is-the-code-testable-”" class="headerlink" title="The second dependency is, “Is the code testable?”"></a>The second dependency is, “Is the code testable?”</h4><p>This is a little trickier to evaluate, so let me illustrate.  There is code that isn’t testable that should be.  I’m not talking about that code.  I’m talking about code that just can’t be tested. Let me illustrate. I’m working with <a href="//www.sencha.com/products/extjs/" title="Ext JS">EXTjs</a> which uses their proprietary implementation of MVC.  The part that is particularly interesting is that the View part of the architecture is basically a JSON object that defines what the view looks like.  While you can put in code that performs some action, the fact of the matter is that this code, when coded correctly, doesn’t really DO anything.  So, I would ask, how would you test this?  Sure I could put it in a test harness and run it through  some sort of parse routine or something, but unless you can say, “when I do this, this other thing over here should be true (or false)” you really can’t test the code.  A class that has no methods is basically a structure and structures can’t, by definition, be tested. On the other hand, I wrote some code once in WinForms that I was able to get under test and execute by calling the methods directly in the form.  I would have been better off moving that code into a presenter class so I could test the functionality separate from the presentation (view) and marked the view as untestable.</p>
<h4 id="Finally-I-have-to-ask-“Is-refactoring-allowed-”"><a href="#Finally-I-have-to-ask-“Is-refactoring-allowed-”" class="headerlink" title="Finally, I have to ask, “Is refactoring allowed?”"></a>Finally, I have to ask, “Is refactoring allowed?”</h4><p>This is legacy code we are talking about.  And legacy code is notoriously hard to unit test.  As I mentioned a <a href="/why-johnny-cant-do-test-driven-development/">couple of weeks ago</a>, in order to write unit test, the code has to be testable in the first place.  So, if the code isn’t in a condition that it can be unit tested, and you aren’t allowed to make the code testable, then either 100% code coverage isn’t possible or you aren’t unit testing.  It’s that simple.</p>
<h2 id="Testing-is-boring"><a href="#Testing-is-boring" class="headerlink" title="Testing is boring"></a>Testing is boring</h2><p>Next, I’d like to address the issue of testing being boring.  I can understand this.  Most of my day is spent unit testing code I’ve previously written because when I wrote it, I wasn’t as good at unit testing as I am today. But, you know what I’ve found along the way?  That by making sure the code is covered 100% it has made me think about how I’ve structured my code and it has made my code more maintainable. But, mostly I find testing entertaining because I learn just a little more about testing.  I get to prove to myself and my peers that writing unit test really does find bugs we didn’t have any idea were there.  I get to perfect my craft just a little bit more. Here are some things to consider about the statement that “testing is boring.”  You may not like what I have to say, but keep in mind, I don’t know you and I don’t know Kris.  I just know what the research says about the state of being bored.</p>
<h4 id="Dictionary-Definition"><a href="#Dictionary-Definition" class="headerlink" title="Dictionary Definition"></a><a href="//www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/bored">Dictionary Definition</a></h4><blockquote>
<p>feeling impatient or dissatisfied, because you are not interested in something or because you have nothing to do.</p>

<p>People who get bored easily are usually anxious people. They’re also having quite a low level of self-esteem. If you’re constantly challenging yourself by trying to stop what you’re doing, because you don’t “like” it, you end up considering yourself an inappropriate person.</p>

<p>Boring people get bored</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  Personally, I find that I’m most bored when I have something else I’d rather be doing.  It isn’t so much that I don’t want to do what I’m currently doing as I’d rather be doing something that I can’t currently do.  I had this experience on Friday because on Thursday night I had found an article on SEO stuff that I desperately wanted to start putting into practice. What I’m suggesting here is that if you change your perspective from one of, “this is a ridiculous idea” to “this is a challenge to be met” or “this is an opportunity to learn”, or even (to address a specific comment that started this post) “I get to make my this application more bug free.”  you may find that the boredom leaves. Treat it as a game.  Maybe pair up with people on your team and see who can discover the most bugs during the day.  Create a leader board.  Since you have to do this anyhow, make it fun.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/03/hand-039.jpg" alt="hand-039" title="hand-039">This past week I’ve been thinking a lot about changing habits and how much of our lives habits influence. To be clear, I would define a habit as something we have learned to do as an automated response to some trigger.  Something we no longer think about doing, but we just do because … well … because we’ve always done it that way. I have some bad habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat something sweet when I’m tired or bored.</li>
<li>How I react to particular situations</li>
<li>… others I’m not so willing to share publicly …  :)</li>
</ul>
<p>And some good habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up before 4:40am</li>
<li>Go to bed at 9:00pm</li>
<li>Write a blog post once a week</li>
<li>Watch <a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight</a> videos for 30 minutes every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>And some habits I’m trying to form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise every day</li>
<li>Take my vitamins</li>
<li>Work on my book for 30 minutes each day</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-I-Deal-With-Habits"><a href="#How-I-Deal-With-Habits" class="headerlink" title="How I Deal With Habits"></a>How I Deal With Habits</h2><p>Now, I’ve learned that the best way to conquer bad habits is to replace them with good habits.  So, for example, since I believe that fat is better than sugar, I might decide to eat cheese rather than cookies when I’m bored. I’ve also learned that if I can set an alarm, I’m more likely to do something.  In fact, my life is run from my calendar on my phone.  If you want me to do something for you, the best way to make sure I do it is to make sure I’ve scheduled it.  I’m kind of obsessive about keeping appointments, so this works well for me. The other thing that works well for me is doing something at the same time every day, or every week.  So, I write blog post, pay bills, do household chores and prepare for a Bible study that I run on Saturdays.  I watch <a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight</a> videos and work on the book that I’m writing first thing every morning.  I take my vitamins at the same time each day. It is the routine that helps maintain the habit.</p>
<h2 id="Start-Small"><a href="#Start-Small" class="headerlink" title="Start Small"></a>Start Small</h2><p>I often end up coaching people who want to start some new habit.  Maybe you’ve been reading my blog and you’ve been challenged to start implementing <a href="/categories/TDD/">Test Driven Development</a>.  What I find is that people want to start at the end.  So, let’s say you want to run 3 miles every day.  If you start out the first day and run three miles, I can pretty much assure you that you’ll give up right away.  No, what we need to do is something much smaller. I started exercising a couple of years ago, I realized that if exercising required me to go to a gym, I was never even going to get started.  The question I often ask people is, “What CAN you do?”  So I asked myself that question.  The answer came back, “I can do one exercise every hour and a half during the day. Then I started working outside of the house and the change in routine slowly eroded my ability to exercise.  So once again, I asked myself, “what CAN you do?”  I can do one exercise every morning.  Once I’ve established that habit, I plan on increasing to two exercises. So, if you want to start with TDD, probably the best way to start is to write a test.  One test.  Maybe commit to writing one test a day.  Think about it, if you are afraid that TDD won’t be accepted in your organization, who’s going to complain about one little test?  Or maybe better, just commit to a half hour of writing tests every day.  This allows you to get started without taking the huge time commitment learning TDD properly would take, which is probably what is keeping you from starting in the first place.  Start today.  Start now.  In a year, see if it hasn’t become how you develop code. What I’m still working on are ways that I react to situations.  These are a bit trickier to change because most of my responses are what people would called “learned responses.”  What I need to figure out is, 1) where did I learn these responses, 2) why did I learn them and 3) do the responses still make sense?</p>
<h2 id="Better-Than-Before"><a href="#Better-Than-Before" class="headerlink" title="Better Than Before"></a>Better Than Before</h2><p>A couple of resources caught my eye this week that I think you might be interested in if you are interested in killing bad habits or starting a new one. The first is a new book by Gretchen Rubin called, <a href="/betterThanBefore">Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Lives</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davmbusnetapp-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0385348614" alt>which will be out by the time this post goes live (I write these blog post well in advance of when you actually see them). What I’ve found particularly interesting is that Gretchen has developed a framework for how to determine how people respond to expectations, and <a href="//www.gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2014/03/quiz-are-you-an-upholder-a-questioner-a-rebel-or-an-obliger/">you can take a test to find out how you respond to expectations</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upholders: respond readily to outer and inner expectations.</li>
<li>Questioners: question all expectations; they’ll meet an expectation _if_ they think it makes sense; essentially, they make all expectations into inner expectations</li>
<li>Obligers: meet outer expectations, but struggle to meet expectations they impose on themselves</li>
<li>Rebels: resist all expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>Gretchen says, if you don’t want to take the test, you are probably a rebel, so don’t worry about it ;). Anyhow, I’m looking forward to reading the book when it comes out. I came out as an upholder, which is no real big surprise.  There are areas of my life that are HEAVILY influenced by what I think people expect of me, and I tend to question new expectations that are imposed on me. And yet, I still have trouble trying to implement new habits in my life.</p>
<h2 id="Coach-ME"><a href="#Coach-ME" class="headerlink" title="Coach ME"></a>Coach ME</h2><p>This brings me to my second resource.  I’ve known about this one for a while, but I’ve just recently really started using it. <a href="/coachme">Coach.me</a> is an app for iPhone and Android that allows you to use the power of community and accountability to help you establish your habits and achieve your goals.  If you want, or need, there is also  coaching that you can pay for if you want or need a little extra help. Right now, I’m just using the alarm and check-in feature.  Somehow being able to open the app and check the box that says I finished a particular activity is enough encouragement for me to not blow it off.  It probably helps that if I don’t check it off, I’ll forever have a hole in my calendar forever saying, “Yo!  you missed a day.” At some point, I may actually use one of the coaches.  I keep looking, but I haven’t found anyone that looks like someone I can relate to.  Or, maybe I just need to grow out of my 3 year old self that wants to do everything on my own.  That’s another area I’m working on.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/02/land-0148.jpg" alt="land-0148" title="land-0148"> As you start your journey down the road of Unit Testing you will discover that part of what makes code testable is this concept of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" title="Dependency injection">Dependency Injection</a>.  As you explore further, you will see people mentioning various Dependency Injection frameworks. You may naturally assume that to implement Dependency Injection, you will need to select an use a Dependency Injection framework. But, Dependency Injection has nothing to do with using a Dependency Injection framework.  The frameworks are there because: 1.  much of our existing code is code that has too many dependencies and the framework helps us break those dependencies without having to refactor too much of our code and 2. to give us a way to easily swap out one object for another when our code is structured in such a way as to not have dependencies at all. </p>
<h2 id="So-what-then-is-Dependency-Injection"><a href="#So-what-then-is-Dependency-Injection" class="headerlink" title="So, what then is Dependency Injection?"></a>So, what then is Dependency Injection?</h2><p>I once heard this maxim that explains it best,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classes should either create stuff, or do stuff, but no one class should do both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of our code looks something like this:</p>
<p>private static void ReceiveSAMLResponse(<br>    out SAMLResponse samlResponse,<br>    out String relayState)<br>{<br>    // Receive the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language" title="Security Assertion Markup Language">SAML</a> response over the<br>    //specified binding.<br>    XmlElement samlResponseXml;</p>
<pre><code>ServiceProvider.ReceiveSAMLResponseByHTTPPost(
    HttpContext.Current.Request, 
    out samlResponseXml, out relayState);
SAMLResponse resp = new SAMLResponse(samlResponseXml);
XmlElement samlAssertionElement = 
    resp.GetSignedAssertions()\[0\];

// Verify the response&apos;s signature.
XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();
//metadata file path (holds the description key).
doc.Load(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(&quot;~/SAML.xml&quot;));
XmlElement root = doc.DocumentElement;

if (!SAMLAssertionSignature.Verify(
    samlAssertionElement, ReadMetadata(root)))
{
    samlResponse = null;
    relayState = null;
    return;
}
// Deserialize the XML.
samlResponse = new SAMLResponse(samlResponseXml);
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>Yes, this is real code from a system I worked on.  The original code was written three or four years ago and this specific code is code I was given by another company.  I just used copy and paste inheritance to get it working in our code. That’s not to say I haven’t written cod that has just as many problems. There are several things that are wrong with this code, but for now all I want to focus on is the Dependency Injection issue. All this code is trying to do is to deserialize the encrypted samlResponse object that was posted to the login form.  At least this code isn’t in the login form!  It has that much going for it.</p>
<h2 id="But-here-are-places-where-it-is-dependent-on-too-much"><a href="#But-here-are-places-where-it-is-dependent-on-too-much" class="headerlink" title="But here are places where it is dependent on too much:"></a>But here are places where it is dependent on too much:</h2><ul>
<li>ServiceProvider is a static class and called directly.</li>
<li>ReceiveSAMLResponseByHTTPPost is dependent on the Request object that we retrieve from HttpContext.</li>
<li>I create a new SAMLResponse object right before I call GetSignedAssertions()</li>
<li>I create a new XmlDocument object so I can load the SAML.xml file</li>
<li>SAMLAssertionSignature is static and called directly</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, this method is one huge dependency mess.  And I’m very aware of the mess that it is in because the company we wrote this code for just recently switched providers.  As we tried to get this working, I had no way of testing this code in isolation without adding code directly into this method.  We got it working, but it didn’t have to be that hard.</p>
<h2 id="So-here’s-what-I’d-do-to-this-code"><a href="#So-here’s-what-I’d-do-to-this-code" class="headerlink" title="So, here’s what I’d do to this code."></a>So, here’s what I’d do to this code.</h2><ul>
<li>Since ServiceProvider and SAMLAssertionSignature are calls to a third party API, I would wrap them in a none static class that I can instantiate.</li>
<li>I would have the class that ultimately calls this method either pass in the dependent objects to the constructor, pass them in to the method that calls this, or set properties in the class.  This is what it means to inject dependencies.</li>
<li>I would look for some way to avoid creating a new SAMLResponse object.  I’m not looking at the API documentation, but it would be great if I could new up the object and call a method, or set a property to give it the samlResponseXml variable.  If I had to, I’d probably wrap SAMLResponse in another class so that I could gain this functionality.</li>
<li>Finally, I would make each of the dependent object based on an interface so that I could swap them out.  In the case of some of these classes, I may need to wrap them in another class that I have control over so that I can implement an interface.  For example, as things stand, I would not be able to create a fake request object because Request is a system class that does not implement an interface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h2><p>After making all of these changes, I would be able to create a test harness for this code, create fake versions of the objects, and verify that this method does what we intend for it do do. Where this would have been particularly helpful is over this last week when we were trying to get this all working with the new provider.  In that case, I could have faked out the request object with what they were sending us and run it through a debugger to figure out what wasn’t quite right.</p>
<h2 id="No-Dependency-Injection-Framework"><a href="#No-Dependency-Injection-Framework" class="headerlink" title="No Dependency Injection Framework"></a>No Dependency Injection Framework</h2><p>Finally, you’ll notice that no where in this code did I have to use a Dependency Injection framework to get this all working.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/02/ppl-kid-05.jpg" alt="ppl-kid-05" title="ppl-kid-05">Last week we looked at a few excuses developers give for not testing their code as they develop it (<a href="/excuses-for-not-testing/">Excuses For Not Testing</a>).  We finished that by mentioning that most of the code you write simply isn’t testable.  You can’t practice Test Driven Development on something that isn’t testable in the first place. And there, folks, is why Johnny can’t test.   </p>
<h2 id="But-it’s-not-Johnny’s-fault"><a href="#But-it’s-not-Johnny’s-fault" class="headerlink" title="But, it’s not Johnny’s fault."></a>But, it’s not Johnny’s fault.</h2><p>Think about what makes code testable.  At it’s core, testable code is loosely coupled.  But what do we mean by “loosely coupled”? Well, let’s start with the large picture.  Assuming you have a multi-layered architecture.  That is, you have your code broken out into View, Business Rules, and Data Access.  Raise your hand if your business rules access your view directly.  Would you be able to test your business rules without your view? At a finer level of detail.  How much of your code creates the objects it needs within the same class, or worse, the same method, that will need it?  Without using a Dependency Injection framework, could you swap out any objects your class uses?  Have you even heard the rule, “Classes should either create things or do things, but never both within the same class?”  If you did that, how much more testable would your code be? If you were to write a test for a method, how much setup work would you have to do?  If it is more than a few lines, your method is probably doing too much, either directly or indirectly.  You’ll need to find a way to make it do less. Maybe in future post, I’ll address some of these issues in code.  But for now, I just want to address the problem. Again, it isn’t Johnny’s fault that he doesn’t know this stuff.  Think about the code samples we tend to look at.</p>
<h2 id="When-is-the-last-time-you-saw-sample-code-that-was-testable"><a href="#When-is-the-last-time-you-saw-sample-code-that-was-testable" class="headerlink" title="When is the last time you saw sample code that was testable?"></a>When is the last time you saw sample code that was testable?</h2><p>Short rant here, but I’ve been working with EXTjs (version 4.x) for the last year and a half.  Sencha will tell you that this uses a MVC architecture.  But what they mean by “Controller” really functions more like a “ViewController.”  That is, the controller is tightly bound to the view that it handles events for.  The way they have things setup, you access View elements by getters that are automatically generated for you in the view. The problem with this is that you can’t really test the controller logic without bringing along the view. Sencha isn’t the only company who does this.  Most of the sample code for WebForms did the same kind of thing. Now, the reason this is an issue is that sample code is how most of the newer programmers are learning how to program. I heard recently that statistically, because of the growth of the industry, half of the programmers available have 5 years or less of experience.  I don’t know about you, but the first 5 years of my programming career, I was still figuring out how to program.  I wasn’t thinking about architecture issues and I certainly wasn’t thinking about formal testing.  From what I’ve seen of the new recruits, I don’t think they are either.  Shoot.  Some of the ones I’ve interacted with couldn’t code themselves out of a paper bag without help.</p>
<h2 id="And-so-what’s-the-conclusion-to-all-of-this"><a href="#And-so-what’s-the-conclusion-to-all-of-this" class="headerlink" title="And so, what’s the conclusion to all of this?"></a>And so, what’s the conclusion to all of this?</h2><p>I don’t know.  Maybe the first step is to admit that we have an issue here and that the issue is so much a management or time issue as it is an education and laziness issue.  That the code we generate shouldn’t assume that people will take the code and adapt it into testable code, but that we should write testable code as our sample code.  Maybe colleges should teach basic software architecture and TDD as part of the curriculum.  Maybe those of us who know better should just start testing and figure this all out well enough to explain it to others.</p>
