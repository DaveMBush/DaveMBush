        <p>A couple of weeks ago, we discussed <a href="/value-type-vs-reference-type/">Value types and Reference types</a> where we said that a reference type points to the value it represents and a value type is the value it represents. This has implications when we work with the assignment operator because when you assign a reference type and change the content of what it is pointing to, both variables get changed because they are both pointing to the same location in memory.  If you do this with a value type, only the one you change sees the change because you are working with a copy.</p>
<h2 id="Is-String-A-Value-or-Reference-Type"><a href="#Is-String-A-Value-or-Reference-Type" class="headerlink" title="Is String A Value or Reference Type?"></a>Is String A Value or Reference Type?</h2><p>So, if you’ve done any work with the String class, you might think it is a value type, because if you write this code:</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>string b = a;<br>string b = “def”;<br>Console.WriteLine(a);<br>Console.WriteLine(b);</p>
<p>You will quickly discover that the values that get written out are: abc def Which is not what you’d expect if String is a reference type. So, the question we need to ask is, why is String acting like a value type if it is really a reference type?</p>
<h2 id="Strings-Are-Immutable"><a href="#Strings-Are-Immutable" class="headerlink" title="Strings Are Immutable"></a>Strings Are Immutable</h2><p>The answer is that Strings are immutable.  That is, a string never changes.  And if you are a thinking person I can already hear you saying, “Sure they change, just look at this code…”</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>a = “def”;<br>Console.WriteLine(a);</p>
<p>”See, I changed the string variable a from ‘abc’ to ‘def’” And yes, you did change the a variable.  But what did you change?  You didn’t change “abc” to “def” you change what a was pointing to. You see, “abc” is the object of type string and “def” is an object of type string.  All you managed to do was change what a was pointing to. In fact, if you write this code:</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>string b = “abc”;</p>
<p>The result is exactly the same as if you’d written:</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>string a = b;</p>
<p>Because in .NET, there is only one instance of any given string in the system.  The duplicates get optimized out.</p>
<h2 id="String-Concatenation"><a href="#String-Concatenation" class="headerlink" title="String Concatenation"></a>String Concatenation</h2><p>Now all of this has implications when it comes to concatenation. Let’s say you write this code:</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>string b = “def”;<br>string c = a + b;</p>
<p>What’s happening here? First we create a string object that contains “abc” and point the a variable to it.  Then we create another string object that contains “def” and point the b variable to it.  And now this is where strings get interesting because the next thing that happens is that a NEW string object is created that contains “abcdef” and we point the c variable to that new value. Now, if you think about this for a minute, you’ll understand that this is incredibly inefficient.  Creating new objects is one of the most expensive operations that anyone can do is just about every object oriented language we have available.  In fact, I can’t think of one where this is not true.  I’m just assuming there must be an exception to the rule. It would be much more efficient if we were to make string so that it wasn’t immutable.  This would mean we could skip the create new object part of the assignment and our concatenation operations would work much faster.</p>
<h2 id="StringBuilder"><a href="#StringBuilder" class="headerlink" title="StringBuilder"></a>StringBuilder</h2><p>Enter StringBuilder.  StringBuilder is, essentially, the mutable version of the String class.  Now you can write code that looks like this:</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>string b = “efg”;<br>string c = “hij”;<br>var d = new StringBuilder(a);<br>d.Append(b);<br>d.Append(c);<br>string e = d.ToString();</p>
<p>Note, at the end, we still have to convert our StringBuilder object to a String object using ToString().  So, there is a new object creation penalty there.  What this means is that you probably don’t want to use a StringBuilder unless you are appending to a string more than three times. So, there you go.  That’s the difference between String and StringBuilder, why a String looks like a value type, and when you should use StringBuilder instead of String.</p>

        <p>Many people starting out with Unit testing get stuck when it comes to using their tools with the Visual Studio environment.  If it isn’t built in, how do we make it work with Visual Studio?  In this article I want to explore the basics of creating a unit test for NUnit and getting it running from Visual Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Basic-Structure"><a href="#Basic-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Basic Structure"></a>Basic Structure</h2><p>To create a unit test, the first thing you will need to do is to create an assembly with a class file to hold the code. The type of assembly you will need to create for your test to be able to run is an assembly of type “Class Library.” I’m going to assume that you don’t need the details on how to create that type of project using whatever version of Visual Studio you happen to be using.</p>
<p>Within your new Class Library project, you should find a file named Class1.cs. For the purposes of getting started, you can just leave that file. We’ll talk about how to name your class and test later on. For now, all we want to concentrate on is the basics of what is involved in getting a basic test going and what the components of a test class are that you will repeat over and over again as you create unit test for your applications.</p>
<p>Before we add our first line of code, though, you will want to add references to NUnit in your code. The easiest way to do that is by using NuGet. Since I use Visual Studio 2013, all of the references for how to do things will be using Visual Studio (Premium) 2013. So, if you are using that version, you can just follow along. If not, you may need to do some translating.</p>
<p>From the Visual Studio menu, select “Tools” &gt; “NuGet Package Manager” &gt; “Manage NuGet Packages for Solution…”. A window will pop up. Search for NUnit and install the package named “NUnit”. There are other packages available that we will discus later on.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could download NUnit directly from the NUnit site (<a href="//nunit.org">http://nunit.org</a>) and add a reference directly to nunit.framework.dll.</p>
<h2 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code"></a>Code</h2><p>Now that you have the DLLs installed and referenced in your project, you’ll need to create a test class. For our purposes, we are going to stick with Class1.cs.</p>
<p>There are several things that make a class a test class. First, the class has to be attributed with the [TestFixture] attribute. Second, the methods you want to have run the test have to be attributed with the [Test] attribute and must be public. So, your minimal test class will look something like:</p>
<p>[TestFixture]<br>public class Class1<br>{<br>    [Test]<br>    public void MyFirstTestMethod()<br>    {<br>        // test code here<br>    }<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Running-Tests"><a href="#Running-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Running Tests"></a>Running Tests</h2><p>Now that we have a basic test class, go ahead and compile it. We are going to try running the test next. For that we will need a test runner.</p>
<p>There are several ways to run NUnit test. For out purposes, we are going to use the runner that comes with NUnit. But you might also be interested in one of the alternatives. You can get a 30 day trial of <a href="//www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper by JetBrains</a>. ReSharper has many features, but the one I want to talk about here is the test runner. Any test you create will be immediately runnable from within Visual Studio by right clicking on an icon to the left of your code. You are presented with a menu of options including debugging your test. Believe me, this is the easiest way to debug NUnit test that I know of.</p>
<p>Another easy way to run NUnit test from within Visual Studio is by installing the MSTest adapter. You can get this from <a href="//www.nuget.org/packages/NUnitTestAdapter/">NuGet</a>.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, we are going to use the test runner that comes with NUnit.</p>
<p>So the next thing you’ll need to do is go to <a href="//nunit.org">NUnit.org</a> and download and install the latest version of NUnit if you didn’t do that already to get the NUnit DLLs installed. I would suggest using the MSI installer rather than the zip file. All we want to be able to do is to run the test.</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed NUnit, there should be a menu option “NUnit” that you can click. This should bring up the GUI runner.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2014/11/image.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>Use the “File” -&gt; “Open” to navigate to the “bin” directory of your NUnit test DLL project and open the DLL. You should see a screen that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2014/11/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>Click the “Run” button to run your test. You should get a green progress bar under the “Run” button and a check box over the icons in the tree on the left indicating that all of the test succeeded.</p>
<p>“Wait?!”, you say, “I didn’t test anything, how did they succeed?”</p>
<p>You are right. A test succeeds if it doesn’t fail. Later on this will impact how we structure our test. So keep this in mind.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about the NUnit GUI runner is that you can keep this up while you work on your tests. By default, the system shadow copies the DLL so that you can compile the DLL in your project. When the NUnit GUI runner sees that the file has changed, it will reload it so that it is always running whatever version you recently compiled. You can change this behavior, if you really feel the need to, by navigating to “Tools” -&gt; “Settings…”</p>
<h2 id="Debugging-Tests"><a href="#Debugging-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Debugging Tests"></a>Debugging Tests</h2><p>As with all things related to code, eventually you will need to debug your test. To do this using the the tools that come with NUnit, do the following.</p>
<p>Right click on the project in Solution Explorer that represents your test project. From the resulting menu, select “Properties.” In the resulting window, select the “Debug” tab from the left-hand side of the window.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2014/11/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>You will want to select “Start external program” and point it to the UNnit runner that got installed when you installed NUnit.</p>
<p>Now, whenever you run this project, with or without the debugger, NUnit will start up. Note: there is no reason to pass parameters telling it what DLL you want to run because it will load the last DLL it had up. But, if you wanted to do that, you could pass the location of the DLL as a parameter to the GUI runner. There are other parameters you can us. Check the documentation for the version of NUnit you are using for the specifics.</p>
<p>If you are running .NET 4.x, you’ll want to go to the location in your file system where NUnit.exe lives and find the NUnit.exe.config file. Find the startup element (<startup> …. </startup>) and place this line in between the open and close startup tags:</p>
<supportedruntime version="4.0">

<p>If you miss this step, you won’t be able to debug your 4.0 code. Alternatively, you can just set your project to use .NET 3.5.</p>
<p>So, let’s give it a try.</p>
<p>First, put some code in the test method you just created. For our purposes, we’ll just put in a console writeline so we have somplace to put a breakpoint.</p>
<p>public void MyFirstTestMethod()<br>{<br>    Console.WriteLine(“Inside MyFirstTestMethod”);<br>}</p>
<p>.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre { font-size: small; color: black; font-family: consolas, “Courier New”, courier, monospace; background-color: #ffffff; /*white-space: pre;*/ } .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; } .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; } .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; } .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; } .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; } .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; } .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; } .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; } .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; } .csharpcode .alt { background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; margin: 0em; } .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</p>
<p>Next set a breakpoint on the Console.WriteLine method and then run your project with the debugger.</p>
<p>Once NUnit loads the DLL, click the “Run” button in NUnit. If everything is setup correctly, you should stop on the breakpoint you set.</p>
<h2 id="Console-WriteLine"><a href="#Console-WriteLine" class="headerlink" title="Console.WriteLine()"></a>Console.WriteLine()</h2><p>You may have noticed that we put several Console.WriteLines() in our code but they aren’t displaying anywhere. So, where did they go? How can we see them?</p>
<p>By default the “Text Output” tab displays all of the Console.WriteLine() messages as well as all of the test results. If all you care to see is the test results, you should select the “Errors and Failures” tab. Personally, I prefer to work in the “Text Output” tab and I suggest that you do the same.</p>
<h2 id="Not-The-Only-Way"><a href="#Not-The-Only-Way" class="headerlink" title="Not The Only Way"></a>Not The Only Way</h2><p>This isn’t the only way to get NUnit &amp; Visual Studio working together.  You could also purchase the ReSharper plugin which has many other features.  But one of the ones I use on a regular basis is the NUnit integration.</p>
<p>You could also use the NUnit test Adapter to make NUnit work with the Visual Studio test engine.  But personally, I don’t like the way the test render using that and I’d much rather use the GUI viewer I’ve discussed in this article.  So, if you want to integrate NUnit &amp; Visual Studio for free, what I’ve outline above is the best way to do it.</p>
</supportedruntime>

        <p>It is amazing to me how few programmers understand the fundamentals of how variables work.  Not just in .NET or C# specifically, but in every language they work in.  It amazes me for two reasons.  First, I don’t think I could program if I didn’t understand what was physically happening as a result of the code I was writing.  Not knowing how the variables relate to the memory that they use would be, to me, a major limitation.  But it also amazes me because I don’t think anyone can program intelligently until they do know what is happening. So, I’ll start from the outside and move in to what’s happening in memory.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-A-Value-Type"><a href="#What-is-A-Value-Type" class="headerlink" title="What is A Value Type"></a>What is A Value Type</h2><p>The first question we need to qualify is, “What types in .NET are referred to as Value types?  Common value types are int, double, float, decimal, and bool.  What we ypically refer to as “primitives”.  But, there are other types that are also value types.  Enums, structs, and DateTime(because it is a struct) are also value types.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-Reference-Type"><a href="#What-is-a-Reference-Type" class="headerlink" title="What is a Reference Type"></a>What is a Reference Type</h2><p>Reference types are any types in .NET that derive from a Class and require the “new” keyword in order to have an instance of a variable of that type. Why didn’t I just say, “any type that derives from a Class?”  Well, the fact of the matter is that every type in .NET derives from a Class.  The top most class is “Object”.  All of the value types derive from the subclass of Object named, “System.ValueType”.</p>
<h2 id="What-Happens-In-Memory"><a href="#What-Happens-In-Memory" class="headerlink" title="What Happens In Memory"></a>What Happens In Memory</h2><p>But it is what happens in memory when we use these variable types that is of interest to us. When you declare a variable that is a Value type and then assign a value to it, the memory that variable occupies holds the value you assigned to it.  The variable is just a representation of the actual value. Contrast this to a reference type.  When you new up (instantiate) a variable that is a reference type, the first thing that is happening is that memory is being allocated to hold the variables in the class and then memory is being set aside to hold a pointer to the memory we just allocated. So, with a reference type, we are only pointing to the memory we are actually using.  With a value type the variable IS the value we are using. This has implications to how the memory is used when we do assignments.</p>
<h2 id="Value-Example"><a href="#Value-Example" class="headerlink" title="Value Example"></a>Value Example</h2><p>For example, look at the code below.</p>
<p>int a = 1;<br>int b = 2;</p>
<p>a = b;</p>
<p>When we assign b to a, we are copying the value occupied by b into the memory location occupied by a.</p>
<h2 id="Reference-Example"><a href="#Reference-Example" class="headerlink" title="Reference Example"></a>Reference Example</h2><p>But what happens when we do the same thing with a reference type?</p>
<p>class Person<br>{<br>    string Name;<br>    int age;<br>}</p>
<p>var joe = new Person();<br>joe.Name = “Joe”;<br>joe.age = 23;</p>
<p>var alice = new Person();<br>alice.Name = “alice”;<br>alice.age = 33;</p>
<p>joe = alice;<br>joe.age = 50;</p>
<p>What will be the value of alice.age? You should say 50 because once we assigned alice to joe, alice and joe point to the same Person object and the Person object that alice pointed to is no longer available.</p>
<h2 id="How-About-Structs"><a href="#How-About-Structs" class="headerlink" title="How About Structs?"></a>How About Structs?</h2><p>But what happens if we make the Person class a struct instead?</p>
<p>struct Person<br>{<br>    string Name;<br>    int age;<br>}</p>
<p>Person joe;<br>joe.Name = “Joe”;<br>joe.age = 23;</p>
<p>Person alice;<br>alice.Name = “Alice”;<br>alice.age = 33;</p>
<p>joe = alice;<br>joe.age = 50;</p>
<p>Now, what is the value of alice.age? In this case, you should say that alice is still 33 because when we assigned alice to joe, joe got a copy of everything that alice had. So, joe’s name is “alice” and before we asign 50 to joe.age, joe.age holds the value of 33.  But the assignment has no impact on the value of alice.age.</p>
<h2 id="Stacks-And-Heaps"><a href="#Stacks-And-Heaps" class="headerlink" title="Stacks And Heaps"></a>Stacks And Heaps</h2><p>Now, no description of value types and reference types would be complete without some discussion of stacks and heaps. The stack is the location in memory that holds value types and reference pointers (remember I said the variable points to the memory being occupied by the value?) in your method. So when you declare a variable inside of a method that memory gets “Pushed” onto the stack. When you pass a variable to another method, that variable gets copied into a temporary variable and placed on the stack. So, doing something like</p>
<p>void Foo()<br>{<br>    int i = 23;<br>    Foo2(i);<br>}</p>
<p>void Foo2(int f)<br>{<br>   // do something with f<br>}</p>
<p>will copy 23 so that the variable f in Foo2 will not be the variable i in Foo. So if we change the value of f in Foo2 to 32, what will be the value of i when Foo2 returns? Because it is a copy, it will still be 23. The heap, on the other hand, is a location in memory that is outside of the scope of the methods we create.  So the only thing being passed around in our functions that use reference variables is pointers.  But, because they are pointers, any thing we do do a reference object inside of a method will be reflected in the variable located inside of the method that called it.</p>
<p>void Foo()<br>{<br>    var p = new Person();<br>    p.age = 24;<br>    Foo2(p);<br>}</p>
<p>void Foo2(Person person)<br>{<br>    person.age = 44;<br>}</p>
<p>So when Foo2 returns, p.age will be 44. However, if we change what person is pointing to…</p>
<p>void Foo2(Person person)<br>{<br>    person = new Person();<br>    person.age = 44;<br>}</p>
<p>p would remain unchanged and p.age would still be 24.</p>
<h2 id="Values-Inside-of-a-Class"><a href="#Values-Inside-of-a-Class" class="headerlink" title="Values Inside of a Class"></a>Values Inside of a Class</h2><p>The final question that you should be asking at this point is when I declare a value type as a member variable of my class, as I’ve done with the age variable in Person above, where is the age variable located, on the stack or on the heap? The answer to that would be it is located in the heap because it is a member of a class that is located in the heap.  And if we created another person object inside of person, the pointer would also be located in the heap and it would point to another location of the heap.</p>

        <p>So, today I had the task of removing the leaves from my yard, which gave me a lot of time to think because it is a pretty solitary job, even if you have people helping you, because much of the time I was using a leaf blower.  It is pretty hard to hold any kind of conversation when you are using a leaf blower.</p>
<p>And  as I was running the leaf blower, I was thinking about what I was going to talk about today.  And then it struck me, why not just talk about cleaning up the leaves?  I mean if John Sonmez and Scott Hanselman can talk about stuff that isn’t necessarily programming related, why can’t I?</p>
<p>But then I realized, I could talk about cleaning up the leaves in my yard AND talk about programming at the same time.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Rake-Leaves"><a href="#Why-Rake-Leaves" class="headerlink" title="Why Rake Leaves?"></a>Why Rake Leaves?</h2><p>Why did I clean up the leaves in my yard?  It wasn’t to make my yard look better.  No one can see my yard from the road.  No one would care but my family, and they do care.  But even if they didn’t, we ultimately clean the leaves off our yards because doing that means our grass will grow better next summer by allowing it to see the sun now.  We do it because nasty critters live in leaves.  We remove the leaves from our drive ways and sidewalks so that snow removal will be easier in the winter.  In short, as hard as the work is to take care of our leaves in the fall, the work is worth it because it makes the rest of the fall and winter easier for us  in the long run.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about the first reason, allowing the grass to get more sun during the fall months, would mean that it would actually be better to clean up the leaves frequently during the fall rather than waiting for them to all fall and then rake them.  By the time I get to them, it is probably too late to do any real good because I wait for them to all fall before I remove them.  By that time, the sun shines less during the day and the frost has already kicked in.</p>
<h2 id="How-Is-This-Related-to-Code"><a href="#How-Is-This-Related-to-Code" class="headerlink" title="How Is This Related to Code?"></a>How Is This Related to Code?</h2><p>And that brings me to our code.  We all have code that needs “raking”.  You know you have code that is duplicated all over the place, but have you taken any time to collect all of that code into one place as a function?</p>
<p>How many code smells do you have.  Are your functions long?  Do you have conditional blocks nested more than one deep?  Do you have classes that do more than one thing?  Have you written code that isn’t being used because “we might need it some day”?</p>
<p>As I work with inexperienced programmers, the one thing I notice is that looking for places to simplify code is a skill that needs to be practiced.  It doesn’t come naturally.  Very few programmers assume that as long as the code does what it should, they are done.</p>
<p>And yet, leaving these code smells in place means that the next time you go in to work on the system, you will not be able to understand the code as well as you should.  Because you haven’t let the sun shine on your code, when you get to it to maintain it, you’ll be working in mud instead of nice green grass.</p>
<h2 id="The-Challenge"><a href="#The-Challenge" class="headerlink" title="The Challenge"></a>The Challenge</h2><p>So today, your job is to find one place in your code that could be made better.  Make it less complicated.  Make it fewer lines of code (without making it hard to read).  Find two places that are doing essentially the same thing and turn that code into a function.  Find two classes that are tightly coupled (highly dependent on each other) and remove the dependencies.  Do this once a day for the next thirty days and see if you don’t find your code easier to work with than it  is today.</p>

  <div class="article-inner">

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>My son is learning to program.  Last week he asked me to explain C# properties get and set and, as it turns out, it looks like many others are asking for the same.  So, I’ve decided to spend the time on this post, explaining getters and setters in about as much detail as one can expect. So here it goes…</p>
<h2 id="Member-Variables"><a href="#Member-Variables" class="headerlink" title="Member Variables"></a>Member Variables</h2><p>So, a class has “member variables” that are typically scoped as private, although they could be (but shouldn’t be) scoped as public.</p>
<p>class SomeClass<br>{<br>    private int _someMemberIntegerVariable;<br>}</p>
<p>Inside the class definition but not in the methods.  You’ll also sometimes see this referred to as a “field”.  I call them “member variables” because that is what I learned them as back when I was programming C++.</p>
<h2 id="Local-Variables"><a href="#Local-Variables" class="headerlink" title="Local Variables"></a>Local Variables</h2><p>If the variable is in a method, it is called a “local variable”</p>
<p>class SomeClass<br>{<br>    public void SomeMethod()<br>    {<br>        int someLocalIntegerVariable;<br>    }<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Class-“State”"><a href="#Class-“State”" class="headerlink" title="Class “State”"></a>Class “State”</h2><p>Now, the reason we have member variables is because they hold the “state” of the object.  For example, you might have a person class (typical example).  The Person class would have a firstName, lastName, birthDate as member variables so that when the class is created (and becomes an object) they can hold the state of the person. “Dave”, “Bush”, 6/20/61.</p>
<p>class Person<br>{<br>    private string _firstName;<br>    private string _lastName;<br>    private Date _birthDate;<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Old-Time-Get-and-Set"><a href="#Old-Time-Get-and-Set" class="headerlink" title="Old Time Get and Set"></a>Old Time Get and Set</h2><p>Now, in the old days (my C++ days) we’d just make those member variables public so that any other class could access them directly.  The problem with that is that any other class could access them directly leaving our class unable to control what exactly came into them.  And so, some gatekeeping was added.  In C++ and Java, that was done with setter methods and getter methods.  In Java that may have changed since the days I programmed in Java, but they started that way at least. That is, setFirstName(string name), setLastName(string name), setBirthDay(date birthday)</p>
<p>class Person<br>{<br>    private string _firstName;<br>    private string _lastName;<br>    private Date _birthDate;</p>
<pre><code>public setFirstName(firstName)
{
    _firstName = firstName;
}
public setLastName(lastName)
{
    _lastName = lastName;
}
public setFirstName(Date birthDate)
{
    _birthDate = birthDate;
}
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>  and to retrieve them…. getFirstName(), getLastName(), getBirthDate() the setters and getters are public (or protected, or private as needed) but the member variables are always private so that only the class they are declared in can access them. Inside the setter, we make sure the data is valid before we set the member variable, or possibly do some sort of computation before we store it, or even pass it on to some other location. But as far as anyone using the class is concerned, it is set setting a value and when it calls the getter, it retrieves the value, or something similar.</p>
<h2 id="C-Properties-Get-and-Set"><a href="#C-Properties-Get-and-Set" class="headerlink" title="C# Properties - Get and Set"></a>C# Properties - Get and Set</h2><p>So along comes C# and that language says, “having a getter method and a setter method is pretty dumb, we should syntactically stich them together.” And so they came up with properties The syntax for that is</p>
<p>private datatype _propertyName;<br>public datatype PropertyName<br>{<br>    get {return _propertyName;}<br>    set{_propertyName = value;}<br>}</p>
<p>Which is all declared inside a class.  The member variable doesn’t have to be named the same as the property, but it often is .  It is customary to name member variables with a leading underscore.  Local variables start with a lowercase character. So, properties and member variables are distinct. Although, you may have thought they were essentially the same thing. At the end of the day, once they are compiled, properties are just methods. But syntactically, you access them as though they were variables.  In fact, if you looked at a property in Intermediate Language (IL), the language that all .NET code compiles to, you would see that it is just a method. To access a property from within your code, you would access it as</p>
<p>someObject.FirstName = “Dave”;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>someVariable = someObject.FirstName;</p>
<p>the only reason they exist at all is to keep the outside world (outside the class) from stomping on the member variables of the class directly. The compiler does for us what the old timers did (and the Java guys still do) using getMethod and setMethod So, as it turns out, we need all that gatekeeping, but the fact of the matter is, many times we don’t. When I was teaching, I’d have guys say, “if I don’t need the gatekeeper, why even bother with the properties?” Which is kind of a valid point But I always countered, “But what if you eventually do?</p>
<h2 id="Enhanced-Properties"><a href="#Enhanced-Properties" class="headerlink" title="Enhanced Properties"></a>Enhanced Properties</h2><p>I think Microsoft heard that so they embellished the language so that we don’t have to declare the member variable if all we are going to do is just pass the data on through to it. That syntax is</p>
<p>public dataType PropertyName {get;set;}</p>
<p>the compiler generates the member variable for you So if I wanted to actually do something with the member variable, you would need to declare the member variable. It depends on what you were going to do with it. If you just wanted to retrieve the data at some other point in your application, you’d just use the property.  But if you needed to manipulate the data as it was being set or retrieved, you’d have to use the original syntax. And that’s properties up until today.</p>

        <p>loading…</p>
<p>This happened a couple of years ago, but it is still relevant because I know of at least one place where it is still happening even though Microsoft has fixed the issue that initially caused this hack to be put in place in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-In-Production-–-Oh-NO"><a href="#Problem-In-Production-–-Oh-NO" class="headerlink" title="Problem In Production – Oh NO!"></a>Problem In Production – Oh NO!</h2><p>Here’s the problem we were seeing.  We had several large PDF files that the client wanted to put up on the site so that their customers could download them.  The problem that we were seeing is that even though the site worked fine under development and QA, the site seemed to consume a lot of memory under load.</p>
<p>Another symptoms we saw was that the file download took a lot of time to start, or timed out completely.  But the main issue was the memory because when the memory was consumed, the site would restart, and because it was a worker process crash that caused it, the restart took the site down.  This is not something you want to see happen when you are working with a client with world wide exposure.  A client who, if I told you the name, I’m sure you would recognize.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the site not responding, or crashing, that first alerted us to the problem.  So, as soon as we knew the site wasn’t responding, I’d log onto the server and fire up task manager to see what was going on.</p>
<h2 id="Server-Management-Tip"><a href="#Server-Management-Tip" class="headerlink" title="Server Management Tip"></a>Server Management Tip</h2><p>One of the things I did early on managing the servers, is that I set up an entirely separate app pool for each of the web sites we are hosting.  This way, we can monitor the memory and CPU activity of each one independently.  For those of you who are interested, the way to make the pool name show up in task manager is to run the pool in ApplicationPoolIdentity, a setting you can get to through “Advanced Settings…”  If you are only hosting one site, you shouldn’t need to do this, but in my case, with multiple sites, this told me a lot about what was going on with the sites and ultimately helped me track down what the problem was.</p>
<p>By the way, you should always run each of your sites under a separate application pool so that when one site is having trouble, every site on your server doesn’t have trouble.  Imagine having an issue and not even knowing for sure which site was causing the trouble.  It’s bad enough not knowing what page is causing the problem.</p>
<h2 id="It-Is-a-Memory-Issue-Now-What"><a href="#It-Is-a-Memory-Issue-Now-What" class="headerlink" title="It Is a Memory Issue.  Now What?"></a>It Is a Memory Issue.  Now What?</h2><p>OK.  So, I could see the memory increasing as soon as the site came back up.  So, now to try to track down what was causing memory issues.</p>
<p>I tried various things along the way, none of them shed any light at all on the problem.  I even got dotMemory from JetBrains to see if I could find anything.  A memory leak maybe?  No, none of my code had even a small leak.</p>
<h2 id="The-Fix-Discovered"><a href="#The-Fix-Discovered" class="headerlink" title="The Fix Discovered"></a>The Fix Discovered</h2><p>And then I finally stumbled on the issue.  I can’t remember what it was that we installed that needed this, but what it did was change our web.config file so that it had a section in it that looks like this:</p>
<p><configuration><br>… lots of other configuration stuff …<br>  &lt;system.webServer&gt;<br>    &lt;modules <strong>runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests=”true”</strong>&gt;</configuration></p>
<p>What that causes IIS to do is to run ALL of your web request through ALL of your .NET modules.  Why is this a problem you ask?  Because it even runs all of your images, css, javascript and other static content.  This isn’t normally a huge problem because most of that stuff is relatively small. But, when you try to run a be PDF through that pipeline, you’ll run out of memory because, and this is the major issue here, because the whole file has to be loaded into memory on the server before it can be sent on to the web browser to download.</p>
<p>Make sure that runAllManagedModulesForAllRequest is either set to false, or doesn’t exist in your web.config file.  If you need it to be turned on for some valid reason that I am not thinking of, at least put your static files on another site where this can be turned off.</p>
<h2 id="Moral-Of-The-Story"><a href="#Moral-Of-The-Story" class="headerlink" title="Moral Of The Story"></a>Moral Of The Story</h2><p>Now, the question that we should be asking now that we’ve figured it all out is, why wasn’t this caught earlier?  When a site goes up, isn’t all of the functionality, including all of the links to all of the images, files to download, and other pages on the site and off the site supposed to be tested?</p>
<p>Yes, of course they are, but if you haven’t at least written down where all of this is, if you don’t have a systematic way of testing EVERYTHING, you WILL end up with these kind of errors once you put the site live.  This is to say nothing of load testing along the way.  This can all be prevented. .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre { font-size: small; color: black; font-family: consolas, “Courier New”, courier, monospace; background-color: #ffffff; /*white-space: pre;*/ } .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; } .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; } .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; } .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; } .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; } .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; } .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; } .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; } .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; } .csharpcode .alt { background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; margin: 0em; } .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</p>

        <p>loading…</p>
<p>This week I discovered CSS Animations.  Well, I shouldn’t say I discovered it so much as I finally spent some time figuring out what it is and why I would care about it.  This could make so much of what we normally do in JavaScript entirely unnecessary.  So, more for my own benefit than anything else, I thought today I would just create a list of resources that are available. But first, why would you want to use CSS for animation when JavaScript could do it just as well?</p>
<h2 id="CSS-and-HTML-live-in-the-same-world"><a href="#CSS-and-HTML-live-in-the-same-world" class="headerlink" title="CSS and HTML live in the same world"></a>CSS and HTML live in the same world</h2><p>As I mentioned a few weeks ago when I discussed JavaScript performance, anytime you manipulate the DOM from JavaScript, you have to cross the HTML/JavaScript boundary.  And to do it right, you have to make sure you work in sync with the key frames that the DOM is living in.  If you don’t, at best you will be animating more than you need to if you use JavaScript to do the animation.  On a phone, this can eat up precious battery life.  For me, this is the biggest reason.</p>
<h2 id="Declarative-Code-Is-Easier-To-Read"><a href="#Declarative-Code-Is-Easier-To-Read" class="headerlink" title="Declarative Code Is Easier To Read"></a>Declarative Code Is Easier To Read</h2><p>I realize that some may disagree with this.  But my feeling is, if I can express in one line what would  take a loop in JavaScript to do, I’ll take the one line of code.  This one of the things that makes Angular attractive.  I can create my own HTML tags.  Why not get the same benefit from my CSS?</p>
<h2 id="Reasons-Why-You-Might-Not"><a href="#Reasons-Why-You-Might-Not" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why You Might Not"></a>Reasons Why You Might Not</h2><p>There are a few reasons why you might not use CSS Animations.  First, it is relatively new.  It may not do everything you want it to do.  So, you may have to resort to using JavaScript for at least some of the things you want to do. Second, it may not support all of the browsers you need to support.</p>

</ul>
<p>When I first suggested “CSS Animations” to a designer friend of mine, he reacted as though I was suggesting putting a flash animation on a web site.  Obviously, we wouldn’t want to do that. But we use animation is some pretty creative ways.  So the next time you reach for JavaScript to add some sort of animation to your web application, do a search for a CSS Animation instead.</p>

<p>I had an interesting puzzle to solve this week that I thought I would share with you in case someone else is looking for a similar solution. There was some code that I needed to test that ultimately called into the database. Since this is a UNIT test and all I was interested in testing was one specific function and the state of one specific field in another  object, I had neither the need, nor the desire, to let that call to the database happen.  Since MOQ is  my mocking framework of choice, I wanted to mock out the database object the method was using so that it would return whatever was expected without actually calling down into the database. There were several problems.  The first was that the database object is a private field in the class I was testing and it got created by the constructor.  Second, the code that needed to use the database object is passing the object by reference (using the “ref” keyword) so that I could no setup my class that needed that object to just ignore it. There were some other items I needed to inject, but they were pretty straight forward.</p>
<h2 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2><p>But first, I realize that some purist out there is going to leave me a comment that says you shouldn’t use a Dependency Injection container in your unit test.  My answer to that is, yes, ideally, one should not do this.  But, not everything is ideal.  Not every project is a “green field” project (and in fact about 95% of them aren’t).  And in some cases there is so much technical debt involved that the best we can do is a hack.  Read, <a href="//www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0131177052&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=davmbusnetapp-20&amp;linkId=2ULNYA2XTSEGDPLA">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davmbusnetapp-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0131177052" alt> for other illustrations of “hacks” to get code under test. So, there’s the problem.  It may not make a lot of sense yet, especially if you are not familiar with the tools.  So let’s walk through some code.</p>
<h2 id="The-Code"><a href="#The-Code" class="headerlink" title="The Code"></a>The Code</h2><p>The main method I wanted to test was hanging off a POCO class.  It is using what we call a “visitor” pattern (though I’m pretty sure this is not what the pattern is supposed to look like).  So we have an Accept() method hanging off of it that knows how to store the poco into the database. That method has a method it calls that hangs off a crud object called Create() that takes the POCO and a reference to the database. I want to mock the Create() method so that it never actually gets called.  The method should return the POCO as part of a list of the POCO’s type. Mocking out the crud object is pretty straight forward:</p>
<p>_mockCrud = new Mock<icrud>()</icrud></p>
<p>  and then registering it with the Unity DI container:</p>
<p>container.RegisterInstance(_mockCrud);</p>
<p>The real issue, and the main point of this post, is that when I wanted to call Create() what I needed to do was:</p>
<p>_mockCrud.Setup(<br>    x =&gt; x.Create(It.IsAny<ipocotype>(),<br>        ref It.IsAny<idatabasetype>())<br>    .Returns(pocoList);</idatabasetype></ipocotype></p>
<p>Which you can’t do. What you have to do instead is:</p>
<p>_mockCrud.Setup(<br>    x =&gt; x.Create(It.IsAny<ipocotype>(),<br>        ref _database))<br>    .Returns(pocoList);</ipocotype></p>
<p>And the only way this will work is if the _database variable is pointing to the same object that will ultimately get called. So, here is the magic that I used to make all that work. Reflection. The database object I needed was created as part of the constructor in yet another object that I pass into the Accept() method.  So, I create that object and then use reflection to get the instance of the database from it.</p>
<p>var visitor = new DataVisitor();<br>var fieldInfo = visitor.GetType()<br>    .GetField(“_database”,<br>        BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);<br>if(fieldInfo != null)<br>{<br>    _database = (Database)fieldInfo.GetValue(visitor);<br>}</p>
<p>And now I can use the Setup code I’ve already specified. Hope that helps someone else.</p>

<p>Whoa there Dave.  What are you talking about?  Have you given up the fight? You who have preached the TDD religion.  You who’ve struggled to get organizations to adopt naming conventions, to use version control systems and to use project management software.  The same guy who has implemented continuous integration on his current project?  What’s this world coming to?</p>
<p>No. Relax. I haven’t given up.  In fact it is precisely because technical debt is inevitable that we need to implement all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="Danger"><a href="#Danger" class="headerlink" title="Danger"></a>Danger</h2><p>But there  is a danger in believing that if we were to implement all of the best practices in the book, or that could ever be devised, that technical debt would simply vanish.  And the sooner some of you realize this, the less stressed out you will be.</p>
<p>You see, no matter how good of a programmer you are today, tomorrow you will be a better programmer.  That is true for all of us.  We are all doing as good of a job as we possibly can today.</p>
<h2 id="A-Story"><a href="#A-Story" class="headerlink" title="A Story"></a>A Story</h2><p>This reminds me of a story I heard once.</p>
<p>It seems there was this programmer who had to make a change to some code and, like we all do, the first thing he did was to try to wrap his head around the code he was looking at.  A few minutes into this common exercise, he starts exclaiming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who wrote this code?</li>
<li>This is the worst code I’ve ever seen.</li>
<li>The guy who wrote this can’t even really call himself a programmer!</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, it got unusually quite in his cubicle.</p>
<p>His friend in the next cube calls over the wall, “Hey John, you OK?”</p>
<p>And John responds, “It’s my code.”</p>
<p>Now, the reason this is a funny story… well, it is a funny story for me anyhow… is because this happens to us all of the time.</p>
<p>I think I spent the first 5 years of my career looking at code I wrote six months ago and thinking, “What was I thinking when I wrote this?”</p>
<p>Even today, 26 years in, I have code I wrote six months or more ago that I know I need to rewrite.  The only reason I haven’t yet is because I want to make sure I have a full test harness around it before I tweak it.</p>
<h2 id="Here’s-the-point"><a href="#Here’s-the-point" class="headerlink" title="Here’s the point."></a>Here’s the point.</h2><p>We are all getting better at what we do.  What we would do today isn’t what we would have done six months ago.  The person who wrote the code you are looking at was doing the best he could at the time.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should just plan on code being “wrong.”</p>
<p>This has two explicit implications to how you relate to your code and your co-workers.</p>
<h3 id="Don’t-be-surprised-by-bad-code"><a href="#Don’t-be-surprised-by-bad-code" class="headerlink" title="Don’t be surprised by bad code"></a>Don’t be surprised by bad code</h3><p>First, you should not be surprised when you find bad code.  You should instead be shocked when you find well written code.  Since even you write bad code, you should be gracious when you find bad code that isn’t yours.  You don’t want to be the guy in the story  I just told.  You might have done the same thing today if you knew only what the person who wrote the code you are looking at knew at the time the code was written.</p>
<h3 id="You-should-expect-that-your-code-will-be-broken-in-some-way"><a href="#You-should-expect-that-your-code-will-be-broken-in-some-way" class="headerlink" title="You should expect that your code will be broken in some way."></a>You should expect that your code will be broken in some way.</h3><p>This has been probably the hardest thing for me to get control of.  I have, historically, been one to deny that my code has a bug.  I’ve taken it as a personal insult, or an assault on my character when someone finds a bug in my code. </p>
<p>Until recently.</p>
<p>Once I was able to internalize the fact that the person reporting the bug was not upset, that the only person who expected me to be perfect was me, and that being wrong was part of being human, I was able to calm down a bit.</p>
<p>You see, none of us are all knowing.  Most of us program for what the code is supposed to do and don’t think about what it shouldn’t do (which is where most of the bugs occur).  The spoken/written language is an imprecise communicator, even if you develop a dictionary for your project.  You’ll never get all of your terms defined.  You just don’t know what you don’t know.  And therefore there will be bugs.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ll think, “I should have known that!”  Well, yes, maybe you SHOULD have.  But the fact is, you didn’t.</p>
<p>When before I used to deny that the bug could even exist, my reaction now is, “Hmmm, wonder what’s going on there.  OK, well, put it in the issue tracker and I’ll get it fixed.”</p>
<p>No drama.  No conflict.  No denial.  No blame.  Just deal with the issue.</p>
<h2 id="This-is-what-it-means-to-be-Agile"><a href="#This-is-what-it-means-to-be-Agile" class="headerlink" title="This is what it means to be Agile"></a>This is what it means to be Agile</h2><p>And you see, this is the beauty of the Agile methodology.  Agile assumes we aren’t going to get it right the first time.  It assumes humans are poor communicators.  It assumes that programmers aren’t going to understand the problem the first time they try to come up with a solution.  It assumes technical debt is inevitable.</p>
<p>Isn’t it time that you do too? Or am I the only one who has suffered with this problem?</p>

<p>As many of you know, I’ve been using <a href="//www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> to do my website testing.  And, if you’ve done any testing with Selenium yourself, you know that Selenium can be even slower if you are using Selenium Grid. There are several things you might do today to achieve Selenium Performance improvements in order to increase the speed that your of your test run.</p>
<h2 id="CacheLookup-attribute-or-Annotation-if-you-are-using-Java"><a href="#CacheLookup-attribute-or-Annotation-if-you-are-using-Java" class="headerlink" title="CacheLookup attribute (or Annotation if you are using Java)"></a>CacheLookup attribute (or Annotation if you are using Java)</h2><p>This is probably the most obvious place for improvement.  Assuming you are using the Page Model pattern in your testing, your page model should have properties that already look something like:</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using = “radioButton”)]<br>private IWebElement RadioButton{ get; set;};</p>
<p>What you may not know is that the way this works is that EVERY time you access the property named RadioButton it will lookup the location of the radio button.  The RadioButton property is actually a proxy for the real IWebElement that it will lookup on the fly. So, if you are using the element more than once in your test, it will perform the lookup each time you access the RadioButton property. By adding the CacheLookup attribute to the RadioButton property,</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using = “radioButton”), CacheLookup]<br>private IWebElement RadioButton{ get; set;};</p>
<p>you can force the RadioButton to be resolved once and only once. Most of my test ask for elements once per test, so I didn’t see any major performance gains by adding this.  Your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2 id="CacheLookup-Warning"><a href="#CacheLookup-Warning" class="headerlink" title="CacheLookup Warning"></a>CacheLookup Warning</h2><p>Be careful when adding CacheLookup to your properties because any time the HTML is recreated, the element will become “stale” and you’ll need to look it up again. For example, in one of the pages I’m testing, I have two modal windows that get created as part of the test.  Each time they are created, they have to be resolved again because the old ones no longer exist. It would be like trying to reference a pointer to an object that no longer exist because something else deleted it.  Actually, that’s exactly what is happening.</p>
<h2 id="CacheLookup-Only-Solves-One-of-Your-Problems"><a href="#CacheLookup-Only-Solves-One-of-Your-Problems" class="headerlink" title="CacheLookup Only Solves One of Your Problems"></a>CacheLookup Only Solves One of Your Problems</h2><p>But if all you do to your site is add CacheLookup, you are wasting your time.  You have to start thinking like your code. Did you know that every time you access a property on an IWebElement, Selenium has to make a call to the browser to access the current value? Yep. Actually, if you think about it, this is what you hope it does.  It is what makes code like this work:</p>
<p>Wait.Until(x =&gt; Page.RadioButton.GetAttrinbute(“disabled”));</p>
<p>But how many times to we write code that goes after a property multiple times when we know the value, or at least we assume the value, hasn’t changed? Or how many of you are doing the same thing multiple times in the same test? For example, in the code I’m testing currently, I have a header and a footer that I need to hide so that when an element is scrolled into view by Selenium, it doesn’t scroll under the header or the footer. I’m currently hiding and showing every time I perform some action on an element.  But now that I’m starting to think about performance, I’m asking myself, “What was I thinking?!” In this case, I would save a lot of time by turning the header off once a the beginning of my test.  I bet my test end up running twice as fast simply by doing that. So, keep in mind that every Selenium call you make is probably going to have to access the server in order to perform the action or retrieve the value you are looking for and try to write your code so that you are only making that call to the server one time per test. I bet you see some performance improvements.</p>
