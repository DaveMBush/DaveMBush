        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/01/YouArentDoingScrumIf.png" alt="You Aren&#39;t Doing Scrum If..." title="YouArentDoingScrumIf">I’ve been frustrated lately by the flippant use of the words “Scrum” and “Agile” in our industry.  They’ve officially made it to the point of “buzzwords that mean nothing” that get slapped onto job requirements like the typical requirements we’ve all seen. </p>
<ul>
<li>Must be able to communicate</li>
<li>Must be able to work in a team environment</li>
<li>Must be able to work under pressure</li>
<li>Must be able to work in an Agile environment</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s really funny is when I see</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet tight deadline</li>
<li>Expert in Agile</li>
</ul>
<p>together in the same job request.</p>
<h2 id="Really-Do-you-know-what-you’re-saying"><a href="#Really-Do-you-know-what-you’re-saying" class="headerlink" title="Really?  Do you know what you’re saying?!"></a>Really?  Do you know what you’re saying?!</h2><p>Many people even use the words “Agile” and “Scrum” interchangeably.  Most because they really do think they are the same thing. I’m finding that what most people mean when they use these words is, either, “we work really fast”, “we work iteratively”, or “we don’t really have a plan.”</p>
<h2 id="So-the-first-thing-we-need-to-clarify-is-what-is-Scrum-and-what-is-Agile"><a href="#So-the-first-thing-we-need-to-clarify-is-what-is-Scrum-and-what-is-Agile" class="headerlink" title="So, the first thing we need to clarify is, what is Scrum and what is Agile."></a>So, the first thing we need to clarify is, what is Scrum and what is Agile.</h2><p>Agile is a set of values.  It is what we believe about software development specifically and, I would argue, also impacts how we view life.  You might have other beliefs that live on top of Agile, but these beliefs will have an impact on how you manage the software development process specifically and your organization in general. Check out the <a href="//www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>.  This is what it means to be Agile. In contrast to this, Scrum is a methodology that helps an organization BE agile. Now here is where things get tricky for some people.  They read in the manifesto that we should value “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools” and think that they can make Scrum be whatever they want it to be because, they would say, “we don’t value processes and tools”. But the Agile Manifesto never says that.  It says we value individuals and interactions MORE than, not INSTEAD of, processes and tools. So, yes, you can adapt and modify Scrum to fit your situation.  You may need to.  But there are some specific elements of Scrum that you simply can’t ignore because to do so would mean either that you are no longer Agile or you are not implementing Scrum.</p>
<h2 id="And-so-you-aren’t-doing-Scrum-if"><a href="#And-so-you-aren’t-doing-Scrum-if" class="headerlink" title="And so, you aren’t doing Scrum if:"></a>And so, you aren’t doing Scrum if:</h2><h4 id="You-have-deadlines-especially-if-you-have-“tight-deadlines”"><a href="#You-have-deadlines-especially-if-you-have-“tight-deadlines”" class="headerlink" title="You have deadlines, especially if you have “tight deadlines”"></a>You have deadlines, especially if you have “tight deadlines”</h4><p>“Now wait a minute,” you say, “I heard that Scrum has these things called ‘Sprints’ that are a fixed length.  Don’t those qualify as ‘deadlines?’” Well, yes and no.  You see, I don’t think what Scrum treats as a “deadline” is what most managers mean by “deadline.” At the end of the day you’ll get to the end of the Sprint and you’ll show what you’ve got.  The GOAL is to have a complete set of code that you wouldn’t be embarrassed to show to another programmer.  You should have only selected what could reasonably get done in the timeframe of a sprint so that all that needs to be done to complete the task could get done. One of the confusions is that somewhere along the line we were told that at the end of each sprint we should have a “shippable unit of software” and we’ve confused that with “a viably marketable product”  All that shippable means is, “if the customer thinks what you’ve completed so far is something they can use, you would not respond with, ‘but it still needs…’” This ties in with the other way you know you aren’t doing Scrum</p>
<h4 id="You-aren’t-doing-scrum-if-you-don’t-have-a-“definition-of-done-”"><a href="#You-aren’t-doing-scrum-if-you-don’t-have-a-“definition-of-done-”" class="headerlink" title="You aren’t doing scrum if you don’t have a “definition of done.”"></a>You aren’t doing scrum if you don’t have a “definition of done.”</h4><p>And once again, there is confusion.  To most people, the “definition of done” is “I can ship this code.”  But that may not be appropriate.  You’re definition of done during your first sprint may be “a set of stories that begin to describe the application we are trying to build.”  As you are learning scrum, you’re definition of done may be as simple as, “all of the code we’ve written so far have Unit Test, appropriate documentation, and we’ve learned something of how long a story point will take our team.” Definition of done doesn’t always have to mean “I’ve written code I can ship.”</p>
<h4 id="You-aren’t-doing-Scrum-if-you-HAVE-to-work-more-than-40-hours-a-week"><a href="#You-aren’t-doing-Scrum-if-you-HAVE-to-work-more-than-40-hours-a-week" class="headerlink" title="You aren’t doing Scrum if you HAVE to work more than 40 hours a week."></a>You aren’t doing Scrum if you HAVE to work more than 40 hours a week.</h4><p>One of the benefits of Scrum is that it allows us to pace ourselves.  We no longer scrabble to get stuff done.  We work consistently toward the goal.  But it isn’t a race. I have a rule.  If I tell you something will be done by a set time, I’ll bust my butt to make that happen.  If you tell me when it will be done, good luck with that. Of course, even when I tell someone when something will be done, I pad the estimate with enough hours that I never work more than 45 hours a week.  There is one day, in the 26 years I’ve been doing this where I worked longer than 12 hours. In fact, I had one manager who called me into his office and asked me to come in on Saturdays.  I was already working 10 hour days 5 days a week!  Talk about getting blood out of a turnip! I looked him straight in the eye and said, “I have 50 hours a week in me.  I’d prefer to give them to you Monday through Friday.  But if you want me to come in on Saturday, I can do that, but you are still only going to get 50 hours a week.” Needless to say, I never came in on Saturday.</p>
<h2 id="I-could-go-on…"><a href="#I-could-go-on…" class="headerlink" title="I could go on…"></a>I could go on…</h2><p>I could go on, but these are the really big ones. So, what do you think?  What examples do you have of places that say they are Agile/Scrum environments but don’t have a clue what that means? Leave a comment below.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/01/IsJavaScriptBroken.png" alt="IsJavaScriptBroken" title="IsJavaScriptBroken">I read a post this week that was essentially a rant on the way JavaScript handles concatenation.  It states that JavaScript is in someway “broken” (without actually using that word) because JavaScript does not work the way this person expected it to.</p>
<h2 id="Here-is-a-rebuttal"><a href="#Here-is-a-rebuttal" class="headerlink" title="Here is a rebuttal."></a>Here is a rebuttal.</h2><p>JavaScript works the way JavaScript was designed to work, and the way many other languages work.  The fact that it does not have the Do_what_I_was_thinking() function is a separate issue (which so far as I know, no language has yet). The main statement I have to take issue with is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The + operator is known to most of us as a symbol for addition, so it does not make sense to use it in [the instance where we want to concatenate strings]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh?  Really? How about C++, C#, Java and the various flavors of VB?  Each of these languages have an overloaded + operator that performs concatenation. Then as you read through the article you discover that the REAL issue is the fact that you can’t concatenate numbers by either using the concat() method or by using the + because numbers are … well … numbers. But here again I have to point to the fact that JavaScript works similar to other languages that are not type-safe. For example VBScript, VB6 using variants and probably others have this same basic issue.  If you are going to use the plus operator for concatenation and for math, you have to have rules about when it will be used for each.  Since numbers are typically ADDED together and strings are typically CONCATENATED, it make sense the the default behavior would be for those behaviors to be primary in those instances.  In the case where you want to concatenate two numbers, the obvious choice would be to somehow force them to be strings instead of numbers.  And in all of the languages I know of where this is needed, putting an empty string in the chain of numbers you want to concatenate is how you achieve this behavior. What is humorous is that this person went  through a long series of commands to illustrate how painful it is to actually coerce numbers into being concatenated and then shows a “simple” method they’ve created to create a concat() method for numbers that essentially amounts to what anyone who knows JavaScript well would do inline:</p>
<p>var newValue = “” + number + number</p>
<p>So, no JavaScript isn’t broken any more than any other language.  It has a defined set of rules that it follows.  Saying that it is broken is like saying English is broken.  And frankly, I could make a much stronger case for English being broken than I could for any programming language being broken including JavaScript.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/01/SeleniumGridSetup.png" alt="SeleniumGridSetup" title="SeleniumGridSetup">My experience with setting up Selenium Grid was frustrated by the lack of information available about exactly what I needed to do to get this working. I’ve actually had this working for a while now and I’ve set it up, or helped others set it up now, several times.  So, I guess it is time to write a post about it so I can just send people here when I need to explain the setup. Note, the following discussion already assumes you know something about how to use Selenium without the Grid so there won’t be a lot of code here other than what is need to get the Grid up and running so you can run your test on it.  First, we need to discuss the basic configuration of a Selenium Grid setup.  There are two main parts.  A Selenium Hub, and Selenium Nodes.  The Hub is what your test code will talk to.  Think of it as the traffic cop to all of the browsers you want to test. The Selenium Nodes register themselves with the Hub and tell the Hub what browsers they support. You will only have one Hub, but you might have multiple nodes.  In my basic configuration, I have two nodes running on the same computer as my Hub that support the current version of FireFox and the current version of IE, since those are the only browsers that are officially supported by the organization I am working at.  (These are private sites, and yes, everyone knows Chrome is better than either of those, but you know how fast policies change in large organizations.) OK, so much for theory, here is how to setup your system. First, on the computers that you will be running the Hub and the Nodes on, create a directory to hold all of the files you will need. I generally put all of my files in c:\selenium.  It makes them really easy to find. Since the Selenium Grid runs using Java, make sure you have that installed on the computers you need to run the Hub and Nodes on. OK.  Enough setup.  Now for the actually Selenium Grid files you are going to need. Download the selenium server JAR file.  There is a link to it under the “Selenium Server” section of this page: <a href="//www.seleniumhq.org/download/" title="http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/">http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/</a>.  The current file name is “selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar”.  Place the file in the selenium directories you created.  This is the jar file you will run for both the Hub and the Nodes so you’ll need this on every computer you plan to run the Grid on. For the various browsers you want to run on that need a separate driver, like IE, you’ll also want to download and install the appropriate driver server from that same page and place the EXE on the computer that you plan to run that browser on. OK.  So now to get this running. You’ll want to put the following in a cmd file and place the cmd file in the Selenium directory with all the other stuff on your Hub computer:</p>
<p>“{path to your java directory}\java.exe” -jar<br>    selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar -role hub</p>
<p>This will run the Hub on port 4444.  This is all you need to do.  You should end up with a console window that looks like this: <img src="/uploads/2015/01/Hub1.png" alt="Hub" title="Hub"> The next script you will need to create is the script that will run the node.  Since I only need FireFox and IE11, I run this on the same computer.  I’ll first provide you with that script and then explain it so that you can adapt it for your own situation. Here’s the script:</p>
<p>“{path to your java directory}\java.exe” -jar<br>    selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar -role<br>    node -hub <a href="http://localhost:4444/grid/register/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:4444/grid/register/</a> -browser<br>    browserName=firefox,maxInstances=5,platform=WINDOWS -browser<br>    browserName=”internet explorer”,version=11,maxInstances=5,<br>    platform=WINDOWS,<br>    -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=c:\Selenium\IEDriverServer.exe</p>
<p>The first thing you should note is that we’ve specified the role as “node” with the –role node flag. Since we are a Node, we also have to tell the node where the Hub is so that it can register itself with the Hub.  That is what the –hub <a href="http://localhost:4444/grid/register/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:4444/grid/register/</a> parameter is for.  If you are placing a node on a computer other than the same computer as the Hub, you will obviously need to change the  URL to point back to the Hub computer instead  of localhost. Everything past this point tells the Hub what browsers are supported on this Node.  So, you’ll notice we have two –browser parameters.  One for FireFox and one for IE.  The browser parameter is all one long string.  To specify IE, you’ll want to specify “internet explorer”.  Note the quote marks and the space.  It took me a while to figure this part out.  The next browser parameter is maxInstances and it tells the Hub how many instances of the browser can run on this node.  I hardly ever have more than one running at a time, but specifying 5 allows me to run test even if something goes wrong.  If something does go wrong, the instance will eventually close itself. The next parameter, platform, tells the Hub what platform we are running on.  You may not need  this if all of your platforms are the same.  But if you are running FireFox on Mac, Windows, and Linux, you’ll want to specify this. Since I only ever test the most recent version of FireFox, I haven’t specified a version for FireFox, but for IE, there was a time when I was testing IE11 and IE8.  So, I have the version, 11, specified here for IE to tell the hub that this node runs IE11. The final parameter it took me quite a while to figure out was the –Dwebdriver.ie.driver.  This is how you tell the Node where the IEDriverServer lives.  I imagine there is a similar parameter for the other drivers as well. When you run this code, it will look something like this: <img src="/uploads/2015/01/Node1.png" alt="Node" title="Node"> If you need the –Dwebdriver config information for another browser, you can google for Dwebdriver. and you should be able to find it.  Since the only officially supported Selenium driver is the IE driver, the config for the others may depend on the vendor who supplied the driver.  Oh, the joys of open source. And now, of course, to use all of this, you’ll need to specify in your code that you want to use the Grid drivers and through that, you’ll specify what browser you want the code to run on.</p>
<p>var driver = new RemoteWebdriver(<br>    new Uri(“http://{pathToHub}:4444/wd/hub”),<br>    DesiredCapabilities.Firefox());</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>var driver = new RemoteWebdriver(<br>    new Uri(“http://{pathToHub}:4444/wd/hub”),<br>    DesiredCapabilities.InternetExplorer())</p>
<p>Finally, someone might say, “so why go to all this trouble when you could just use something like SauceLabs?” Well, even if you have SauceLabs setup for your continuous integration, I think you’ll still need something setup while you are creating your tests.  Yes, you could run without the grid while you are writing your test and use the grid as part of your continuous integration process, but my experience is that the grid works just enough differently that you are really better off creating your test using the grid. In my current situation, I have a virtual machine setup to run my test.</p>

        <p>A while ago I wrote an article <a href="/what-is-specflow/">explaining what SpecFlow is, and why you might want to use it</a>.  I’ve been using it for several months now and I’ve recognized several patterns that have emerged in my usage that I wish I had known when I started, so I thought I’d share them with you today.</p>
<h2 id="Small-Features"><a href="#Small-Features" class="headerlink" title="Small Features"></a>Small Features</h2><p>If you are used to BDD or even unit testing, this will be obvious.  But if you are new to all of this, the temptation is going to be to put all of your test in one feature.  While this works in the strictest sense of the word, and you are at least getting test in place, you will find that finding a specific test later on is going to be rather awkward. A feature file should really only have a few scenarios that are testing a particular feature in the system.  This is why, at the top of your feature file, you are stating what exactly the feature is:</p>
<p>As an administrator<br>I need to be able to delete existing users<br>So they cannot access the system any more</p>
<p>Which we would probably put in the “DeleteUser.feature” file. Now that we’ve specified the feature, we need one or more scenarios for this. Each scenario is going to test the various ways you might be able to delete a user.  Maybe you can check boxes and delete them all at once or you can click one button per user and delete them one at a time.  Each of those is a scenario.  So your scenarios might look like this:</p>
<p>Scenario: Delete one user at a time<br>    Given I have 10 users in the system<br>    And I have logged in as an administrator<br>    And I have navigated to the user admin page<br>    When I click the first delete user button<br>    Then I only have 9 users in the system<br>    And I remain on the user admin page</p>
<p>Scenario: Delete one users at a time with checkbox<br>    Given I have 10 users in the system<br>    And I have logged in as an administrator<br>    And I have navigated to the user admin page<br>    When I check the checkbox of the first user<br>    And I click the delete checked users button<br>    Then I only have 9 users in the system<br>    And I remain on the user admin page</p>
<p>Scenario: multiple users at a time using the checkbox<br>    etc …</p>
<p>What about sad path test?  You’ll need to determine if those are another feature or if they are somehow part of the feature you are working on.  For this test, I can’t think of a sad path test for deleting users that is generally applicable.  Most of the time, if you have something that should occur as part of deleting a user, you should be doing that as part of the delete process.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Repeat-Yourself"><a href="#Don’t-Repeat-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Repeat Yourself"></a>Don’t Repeat Yourself</h2><p>The next place you are likely to make a mistake as you learn how to use SpecFlow is that you’ll start out thinking of the feature file, the steps implementation for the features and any setup or teardown of the scenarios as all one unit.  As a result of this, you’ll tend to implement the steps and the setup and teardown (what SpecFlow implements as Before and After) all in one file. The problem with this is that you’ll end up with a lot of duplicate code in your tests. So, let’s say each of your features have similar setup code you need to implement.  In the case of our user administration example that we started out with, you’ll have code you need to implement for adding a user, deleting a user, adding roles to a user, searching for a user, and probably more. For each of those, your Before code is all going to look the same.  So, what I would recommend that you do is create a separate file with your Before and After code in it, nothing more.  You will associate this file with your feature files by associating a category with it and using the category in your feature files.  Now for each feature, the same Before and After code will run. The other issue you are going to have is that you are going to have a lot of the same steps between the feature files.  However, my experience has been that there will be a lot more common features between the code I write for a particular screen then there will be for the Before and After code I write.  For example, I might right Before code for various roles</p>
<p>As a regular user<br>When I visit the user administration screen<br>I should not be able to view any user other than myself.</p>
<p>That will require different setup code from “As an administrator” but the steps to implement the scenarios will probably be very similar. Therefore, you should have a step file that holds all of the steps for a screen full of logic in a file separate from your Before and After logic.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Several weeks ago, I started the process of converting this blog to a responsive design.  At this point it is mostly done.  But it is done enough that I can tell you the process that I went through to get the site converted. I was surprised by how easy the process was.  But I guess I was lucky because the theme I started out with already was following a number of best practices. So, to start out with, if you want to move your site toward responsive web design, there are some prerequisites that you’ll need to pay attention to.</p>
<h2 id="Responsive-Design-–-Prerequisites"><a href="#Responsive-Design-–-Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="Responsive Design – Prerequisites"></a>Responsive Design – Prerequisites</h2><p>First, before you do anything else, you need to make sure your current theme is not using tables anywhere.  If you are, the first thing you will need to do is to convert your them from tables to using DIVs.  The CSS world has been telling you this for years.  And now you see why this is true. Frankly, if you are using tables instead of DIVs for your layout, you are probably better off just starting over. Second, you need to ensure that you don’t have any CSS embedded in your HTML, or even worse, style attributes in your elements that are going to get in the way of your design.  While it is true, you can override these with JavaScript, the less of this you have to do, the better.  So clean that up now. Third, you need to think about what you really NEED to show on the page and what can be  hidden.  Sidebars are a good candidate for hiding since they aren’t your main content.  On this site I have two side bars.  One on the left and one on the right.  I’ve decided that the right sidebar is more important, so I’ve hidden the left one for small screens and both for tiny screens.  You might decide to move them to the bottom instead.  But you might find that more difficult than hiding them.</p>
<h2 id="Responsive-Web-Design-–-HTML"><a href="#Responsive-Web-Design-–-HTML" class="headerlink" title="Responsive Web Design – HTML"></a>Responsive Web Design – HTML</h2><p>With the prerequisites taken care of, let’s look at a small HTML change you will need to make. You will need to add the following META tag into the HEAD area of your HTML:</p>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

<p>I’ll let you search for the technical explanation of what this actually does.  What I’ll tell you is why you need it. If you don’t add this then when you go to view your web site on the iPhone and other browsers that are looking for this tag, you’ll see the full site scaled down to fit on the phone instead of the adaptive rendering you were probably expecting. That is, you’ll have everything working on your desktop so that it works on various screen sizes as you expect, but when you try to render it on your phone, it will scale the full version of the site to fit within the screen.</p>
<h2 id="Responsive-Web-Design-–-CSS"><a href="#Responsive-Web-Design-–-CSS" class="headerlink" title="Responsive Web Design – CSS"></a>Responsive Web Design – CSS</h2><p>Most of your changes will be in the CSS.  This is where a lot of the magic happens.  The first change you are going to want to make to your original design is that you are going to want to make all of your width information percentage values instead of hard pixel values (or EMs, if that’s what you use.) Of course your outer DIV is going to need to be 100%.  But if you do that, and you view your site on a large monitor, your site is going to be really hard to read.   So, to fix that issue, add the max-width attribute to the css definition for that element.</p>
<p>.container{<br>   width: 100%;<br>   max-width: 1200px;<br>}</p>
<p>And now we have to add rules to tell the browsers how to render the page at different resolutions.  To do that, we use media tags. You may have thought that media tags were just for styling the printed version of your web site, or for telling text to speech engines how to read your page.  But they are also useful for telling the browser what rules to use for the various screen resolutions. You can use media tags for screen in the same way that you use media tags for print.  Either by specifying in your CSS or by specifying  in your LINK statement in the HTML.  I choose to put them in my CSS because I wasn’t adding that much information and I compress my CSS anyhow. The basic syntax looks like:</p>
<p>@media screen and (some rule here)</p>
<p>It is the rule bit that gets confusing. The rule bit looks like:</p>
<p>@media screen and (max-width: 600px)</p>
<p>What this says is, only apply this CSS to screen sizes LESS THAN or equal to 600px.  That is, only apply the CSS to a screen who’s max width is 600px. If you are going to mess up anything, this is where it will be. there is also a rule for min-width, so you can say something like</p>
<p>@media screen and (max-width: 600px) and (min-width:300px)</p>
<p>Which would only apply the CSS to a screen width between 300 and 600 pixels. Now, you might be inclined to use a rule like that, but what I’ve found is that most of my CSS is additive.  That is, the rules I applied to max-with of 900 pixels I also want applied to max-width of 600 pixels.  I just want additional rules applied to max-width of 600.  So, I tend to just stack them instead of making a separate rule set for each resolution. Other than removing the sidebars, you may also want to adjust font sizes and banner sizes based on the size of the screen.  That’s what I did here.  You’ll notice that the banner area shrinks as the screen gets smaller.</p>
<h2 id="Responsive-Web-Design-–-JavaScript"><a href="#Responsive-Web-Design-–-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Responsive Web Design – JavaScript"></a>Responsive Web Design – JavaScript</h2><p>OK, so now you have your screens scaling nicely, but you may notice one final issue.  All of those images you have on your site are all a fixed size.  Some of those you might be able to fix by using CSS.  But, in my case the images I had the most trouble with were the images that show up at the top of the post.  So, in my case, I wrote some JavaScript to scale them to fit the width of the container.  I still have to modify the code in some of my older posts to work better with the JavaScript I wrote.  But for the newer posts, this is all working well.  I’ve been thinking about making the scaling code work as the screen size changes, but that’s a lot of work for something most people aren’t going to use. If you do decide to change the screen size and you see the images bleeding over the width of the container, refresh your browser and the images will scale.</p>

  <div class="article-inner">

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This past week a very old (last time I did work for him was in 2007) client of mine contacted me because their program suddenly started exhibiting a problem.  It seems that if a user enters a date anytime in 2015, the program displays an error message indicating that they need to enter a date greater than today and less than two years from today. When I went to replicate the error in my debugger, I discovered this bit of code:</p>
<p>if (Year &lt; 100)<br>{<br>    if (Year &lt; 15)<br>    {<br>        Year += 2000;<br>    }<br>    else<br>    {<br>        Year += 1900;<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>So that, if you enter any date as 15, it assumes the date is 1915 instead of 2015. Now, we are talking about code here that has been around since the DOS days, and I’m pretty sure this particular routine has been around since then too.  I’m sure when it was coded, the year 2015 seemed so distant, that no one considered that the program might actually still be running in some form. But, that’s just the problem with Magic Strings and Magic Numbers.  They can appear to work for years, even decades, and then one day they show themselves for the evil they are. So, how can you guard yourself against using Magic Strings or Magic Numbers? That’s just the issue.  You can’t.  Sometimes they are only obvious once they manifest themselves as a bug.  However, here are a set of common places you should look.</p>
<h2 id="Are-you-working-with-dates"><a href="#Are-you-working-with-dates" class="headerlink" title="Are you working with dates?"></a>Are you working with dates?</h2><p>Yeah, I know, this one is obvious since that’s what we are talking about.  But here are some other places you might want to look. As I’ve considered how I might fix this bug, I’ve decided that what I’ll do is get the current year, find the two digit version and add three to it.  I’ll use that computed date as the century roll over. But code is immortal.  That’s not the only place in this code that needs fixing.  The other place is the 1900 and 2000.  Those should be computed as well.  Not that I plan on being around, in the year 2100 and following, but as long as this code has been around, I should plan on the code being around then.  And it won’t be that much more work to compute those centuries as  century of today and century of today minus 100. The only constant I can see using in the code above is the 100.  Even if it does change, I don’t think anyone will complain too loudly when it does.</p>
<h2 id="Databases"><a href="#Databases" class="headerlink" title="Databases"></a>Databases</h2><p>Another obvious place to look is in your database code. Actually, if you aren’t careful, there are a lot of mistakes you can make here.  But for now, let’s just stick to magic string issues.</p>
<h3 id="Connection-Strings"><a href="#Connection-Strings" class="headerlink" title="Connection Strings"></a>Connection Strings</h3><p>By now, this should be obvious.  Don’t include the connection string to your database in the code of your program.  At the very least, put it in your web.config or app.config file so it can be changed without recompiling your code.</p>
<h3 id="SQL"><a href="#SQL" class="headerlink" title="SQL"></a>SQL</h3><p>If you’ve done any amount of programming, you should know by now that your SQL belongs in your SQL database as a stored procedure.  That’s the best place for it.  However, I’ve had occasions where getting the SQL changed by the SQL gods, otherwise known as the DBAs, is so painful, that including the SQL in your code is much more practical. Here’s a tip.  Keep your SQL code separate from your other code.  Put it in a resource file.  Put it in a text file.  Just don’t put it in your C# or VB.NET code.</p>
<h3 id="POCOs"><a href="#POCOs" class="headerlink" title="POCOs"></a>POCOs</h3><p>Are you generating POCOs to accompany your SQL?  Assuming you can’t use Entity Framework and you have to generate your own POCOs, you should generate your POCOs from your SQL.  That way, if your SQL changes, your POCO code changes automatically.</p>
<h3 id="Schemas-Change"><a href="#Schemas-Change" class="headerlink" title="Schemas Change"></a>Schemas Change</h3><p>And while we are talking about Schemas, I’ll remind you that Schemas change.  Do you have a strategy in place so that you can tell what version of the database schema you are using at any particular time?</p>
<h2 id="The-File-System"><a href="#The-File-System" class="headerlink" title="The File System"></a>The File System</h2><p>File system issues have frustrated me on several occasions.  The most obvious one is the difference between Mac/Linux and Windows.  Now that .NET is going to be available on Mac and Linux, this is something you’ll want to pay attention too.  But, you should also pay attention to assumptions like drive letters.  Will you always want your code saved in this location. We had an issue years ago with the same code base I referred to above when Vista came out and you could no longer save your data files with your program files.  It took several hours of refactoring to get that code into a location that the user had rights to.  That should be a lesson for you.  Once again, just because a hard coded value works today, doesn’t mean it will work tomorrow.</p>
<h2 id="Dave’s-Law-of-N"><a href="#Dave’s-Law-of-N" class="headerlink" title="Dave’s Law of N"></a>Dave’s Law of N</h2><p>This next one is not one you’d naturally think of as a Magic Number, but it is. You go to the customer and get requirements that say there will be two of something.  Maybe the contact record will have two phone numbers.  Or maybe they say there will be three of something.  It doesn’t really matter.  The magic number here is in the number of items that you need to store. I’ve seen this violated in a number of ways.  But the interview question I now ask is something along the lines of, “You need to store a person class in the database with FirstName, LastName, BirthDate, HomePhone, and CellPhone.  Create a database schema to hold this information. If they don’t come back to me with at least two tables, one for the Person and one for Phone numbers, I won’t hire them.  They get bonus points if they also create a third table so that we can classify the phone numbers in the phone number table. And that’s where “Dave’s Law of N” comes in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is two of something there WILL be three of something.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Code it today so that tomorrow we can add the third item without coding.  It won’t take you any longer to do it right today and it will save us time when they eventually realize they should have asked for more. Well, I’m sure that’s not all of the places you should look.  But that’s a start to get you thinking in the right direction.</p>

        <p>A couple of weeks ago, we discussed <a href="/value-type-vs-reference-type/">Value types and Reference types</a> where we said that a reference type points to the value it represents and a value type is the value it represents. This has implications when we work with the assignment operator because when you assign a reference type and change the content of what it is pointing to, both variables get changed because they are both pointing to the same location in memory.  If you do this with a value type, only the one you change sees the change because you are working with a copy.</p>
<h2 id="Is-String-A-Value-or-Reference-Type"><a href="#Is-String-A-Value-or-Reference-Type" class="headerlink" title="Is String A Value or Reference Type?"></a>Is String A Value or Reference Type?</h2><p>So, if you’ve done any work with the String class, you might think it is a value type, because if you write this code:</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>string b = a;<br>string b = “def”;<br>Console.WriteLine(a);<br>Console.WriteLine(b);</p>
<p>You will quickly discover that the values that get written out are: abc def Which is not what you’d expect if String is a reference type. So, the question we need to ask is, why is String acting like a value type if it is really a reference type?</p>
<h2 id="Strings-Are-Immutable"><a href="#Strings-Are-Immutable" class="headerlink" title="Strings Are Immutable"></a>Strings Are Immutable</h2><p>The answer is that Strings are immutable.  That is, a string never changes.  And if you are a thinking person I can already hear you saying, “Sure they change, just look at this code…”</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>a = “def”;<br>Console.WriteLine(a);</p>
<p>”See, I changed the string variable a from ‘abc’ to ‘def’” And yes, you did change the a variable.  But what did you change?  You didn’t change “abc” to “def” you change what a was pointing to. You see, “abc” is the object of type string and “def” is an object of type string.  All you managed to do was change what a was pointing to. In fact, if you write this code:</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>string b = “abc”;</p>
<p>The result is exactly the same as if you’d written:</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>string a = b;</p>
<p>Because in .NET, there is only one instance of any given string in the system.  The duplicates get optimized out.</p>
<h2 id="String-Concatenation"><a href="#String-Concatenation" class="headerlink" title="String Concatenation"></a>String Concatenation</h2><p>Now all of this has implications when it comes to concatenation. Let’s say you write this code:</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>string b = “def”;<br>string c = a + b;</p>
<p>What’s happening here? First we create a string object that contains “abc” and point the a variable to it.  Then we create another string object that contains “def” and point the b variable to it.  And now this is where strings get interesting because the next thing that happens is that a NEW string object is created that contains “abcdef” and we point the c variable to that new value. Now, if you think about this for a minute, you’ll understand that this is incredibly inefficient.  Creating new objects is one of the most expensive operations that anyone can do is just about every object oriented language we have available.  In fact, I can’t think of one where this is not true.  I’m just assuming there must be an exception to the rule. It would be much more efficient if we were to make string so that it wasn’t immutable.  This would mean we could skip the create new object part of the assignment and our concatenation operations would work much faster.</p>
<h2 id="StringBuilder"><a href="#StringBuilder" class="headerlink" title="StringBuilder"></a>StringBuilder</h2><p>Enter StringBuilder.  StringBuilder is, essentially, the mutable version of the String class.  Now you can write code that looks like this:</p>
<p>string a = “abc”;<br>string b = “efg”;<br>string c = “hij”;<br>var d = new StringBuilder(a);<br>d.Append(b);<br>d.Append(c);<br>string e = d.ToString();</p>
<p>Note, at the end, we still have to convert our StringBuilder object to a String object using ToString().  So, there is a new object creation penalty there.  What this means is that you probably don’t want to use a StringBuilder unless you are appending to a string more than three times. So, there you go.  That’s the difference between String and StringBuilder, why a String looks like a value type, and when you should use StringBuilder instead of String.</p>

        <p>Many people starting out with Unit testing get stuck when it comes to using their tools with the Visual Studio environment.  If it isn’t built in, how do we make it work with Visual Studio?  In this article I want to explore the basics of creating a unit test for NUnit and getting it running from Visual Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Basic-Structure"><a href="#Basic-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Basic Structure"></a>Basic Structure</h2><p>To create a unit test, the first thing you will need to do is to create an assembly with a class file to hold the code. The type of assembly you will need to create for your test to be able to run is an assembly of type “Class Library.” I’m going to assume that you don’t need the details on how to create that type of project using whatever version of Visual Studio you happen to be using.</p>
<p>Within your new Class Library project, you should find a file named Class1.cs. For the purposes of getting started, you can just leave that file. We’ll talk about how to name your class and test later on. For now, all we want to concentrate on is the basics of what is involved in getting a basic test going and what the components of a test class are that you will repeat over and over again as you create unit test for your applications.</p>
<p>Before we add our first line of code, though, you will want to add references to NUnit in your code. The easiest way to do that is by using NuGet. Since I use Visual Studio 2013, all of the references for how to do things will be using Visual Studio (Premium) 2013. So, if you are using that version, you can just follow along. If not, you may need to do some translating.</p>
<p>From the Visual Studio menu, select “Tools” &gt; “NuGet Package Manager” &gt; “Manage NuGet Packages for Solution…”. A window will pop up. Search for NUnit and install the package named “NUnit”. There are other packages available that we will discus later on.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could download NUnit directly from the NUnit site (<a href="//nunit.org">http://nunit.org</a>) and add a reference directly to nunit.framework.dll.</p>
<h2 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code"></a>Code</h2><p>Now that you have the DLLs installed and referenced in your project, you’ll need to create a test class. For our purposes, we are going to stick with Class1.cs.</p>
<p>There are several things that make a class a test class. First, the class has to be attributed with the [TestFixture] attribute. Second, the methods you want to have run the test have to be attributed with the [Test] attribute and must be public. So, your minimal test class will look something like:</p>
<p>[TestFixture]<br>public class Class1<br>{<br>    [Test]<br>    public void MyFirstTestMethod()<br>    {<br>        // test code here<br>    }<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Running-Tests"><a href="#Running-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Running Tests"></a>Running Tests</h2><p>Now that we have a basic test class, go ahead and compile it. We are going to try running the test next. For that we will need a test runner.</p>
<p>There are several ways to run NUnit test. For out purposes, we are going to use the runner that comes with NUnit. But you might also be interested in one of the alternatives. You can get a 30 day trial of <a href="//www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper by JetBrains</a>. ReSharper has many features, but the one I want to talk about here is the test runner. Any test you create will be immediately runnable from within Visual Studio by right clicking on an icon to the left of your code. You are presented with a menu of options including debugging your test. Believe me, this is the easiest way to debug NUnit test that I know of.</p>
<p>Another easy way to run NUnit test from within Visual Studio is by installing the MSTest adapter. You can get this from <a href="//www.nuget.org/packages/NUnitTestAdapter/">NuGet</a>.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, we are going to use the test runner that comes with NUnit.</p>
<p>So the next thing you’ll need to do is go to <a href="//nunit.org">NUnit.org</a> and download and install the latest version of NUnit if you didn’t do that already to get the NUnit DLLs installed. I would suggest using the MSI installer rather than the zip file. All we want to be able to do is to run the test.</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed NUnit, there should be a menu option “NUnit” that you can click. This should bring up the GUI runner.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2014/11/image.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>Use the “File” -&gt; “Open” to navigate to the “bin” directory of your NUnit test DLL project and open the DLL. You should see a screen that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2014/11/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>Click the “Run” button to run your test. You should get a green progress bar under the “Run” button and a check box over the icons in the tree on the left indicating that all of the test succeeded.</p>
<p>“Wait?!”, you say, “I didn’t test anything, how did they succeed?”</p>
<p>You are right. A test succeeds if it doesn’t fail. Later on this will impact how we structure our test. So keep this in mind.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about the NUnit GUI runner is that you can keep this up while you work on your tests. By default, the system shadow copies the DLL so that you can compile the DLL in your project. When the NUnit GUI runner sees that the file has changed, it will reload it so that it is always running whatever version you recently compiled. You can change this behavior, if you really feel the need to, by navigating to “Tools” -&gt; “Settings…”</p>
<h2 id="Debugging-Tests"><a href="#Debugging-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Debugging Tests"></a>Debugging Tests</h2><p>As with all things related to code, eventually you will need to debug your test. To do this using the the tools that come with NUnit, do the following.</p>
<p>Right click on the project in Solution Explorer that represents your test project. From the resulting menu, select “Properties.” In the resulting window, select the “Debug” tab from the left-hand side of the window.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2014/11/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>You will want to select “Start external program” and point it to the UNnit runner that got installed when you installed NUnit.</p>
<p>Now, whenever you run this project, with or without the debugger, NUnit will start up. Note: there is no reason to pass parameters telling it what DLL you want to run because it will load the last DLL it had up. But, if you wanted to do that, you could pass the location of the DLL as a parameter to the GUI runner. There are other parameters you can us. Check the documentation for the version of NUnit you are using for the specifics.</p>
<p>If you are running .NET 4.x, you’ll want to go to the location in your file system where NUnit.exe lives and find the NUnit.exe.config file. Find the startup element (<startup> …. </startup>) and place this line in between the open and close startup tags:</p>
<supportedruntime version="4.0">

<p>If you miss this step, you won’t be able to debug your 4.0 code. Alternatively, you can just set your project to use .NET 3.5.</p>
<p>So, let’s give it a try.</p>
<p>First, put some code in the test method you just created. For our purposes, we’ll just put in a console writeline so we have somplace to put a breakpoint.</p>
<p>public void MyFirstTestMethod()<br>{<br>    Console.WriteLine(“Inside MyFirstTestMethod”);<br>}</p>
<p>.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre { font-size: small; color: black; font-family: consolas, “Courier New”, courier, monospace; background-color: #ffffff; /*white-space: pre;*/ } .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; } .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; } .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; } .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; } .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; } .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; } .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; } .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; } .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; } .csharpcode .alt { background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; margin: 0em; } .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</p>
<p>Next set a breakpoint on the Console.WriteLine method and then run your project with the debugger.</p>
<p>Once NUnit loads the DLL, click the “Run” button in NUnit. If everything is setup correctly, you should stop on the breakpoint you set.</p>
<h2 id="Console-WriteLine"><a href="#Console-WriteLine" class="headerlink" title="Console.WriteLine()"></a>Console.WriteLine()</h2><p>You may have noticed that we put several Console.WriteLines() in our code but they aren’t displaying anywhere. So, where did they go? How can we see them?</p>
<p>By default the “Text Output” tab displays all of the Console.WriteLine() messages as well as all of the test results. If all you care to see is the test results, you should select the “Errors and Failures” tab. Personally, I prefer to work in the “Text Output” tab and I suggest that you do the same.</p>
<h2 id="Not-The-Only-Way"><a href="#Not-The-Only-Way" class="headerlink" title="Not The Only Way"></a>Not The Only Way</h2><p>This isn’t the only way to get NUnit &amp; Visual Studio working together.  You could also purchase the ReSharper plugin which has many other features.  But one of the ones I use on a regular basis is the NUnit integration.</p>
<p>You could also use the NUnit test Adapter to make NUnit work with the Visual Studio test engine.  But personally, I don’t like the way the test render using that and I’d much rather use the GUI viewer I’ve discussed in this article.  So, if you want to integrate NUnit &amp; Visual Studio for free, what I’ve outline above is the best way to do it.</p>
</supportedruntime>

        <p>It is amazing to me how few programmers understand the fundamentals of how variables work.  Not just in .NET or C# specifically, but in every language they work in.  It amazes me for two reasons.  First, I don’t think I could program if I didn’t understand what was physically happening as a result of the code I was writing.  Not knowing how the variables relate to the memory that they use would be, to me, a major limitation.  But it also amazes me because I don’t think anyone can program intelligently until they do know what is happening. So, I’ll start from the outside and move in to what’s happening in memory.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-A-Value-Type"><a href="#What-is-A-Value-Type" class="headerlink" title="What is A Value Type"></a>What is A Value Type</h2><p>The first question we need to qualify is, “What types in .NET are referred to as Value types?  Common value types are int, double, float, decimal, and bool.  What we ypically refer to as “primitives”.  But, there are other types that are also value types.  Enums, structs, and DateTime(because it is a struct) are also value types.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-Reference-Type"><a href="#What-is-a-Reference-Type" class="headerlink" title="What is a Reference Type"></a>What is a Reference Type</h2><p>Reference types are any types in .NET that derive from a Class and require the “new” keyword in order to have an instance of a variable of that type. Why didn’t I just say, “any type that derives from a Class?”  Well, the fact of the matter is that every type in .NET derives from a Class.  The top most class is “Object”.  All of the value types derive from the subclass of Object named, “System.ValueType”.</p>
<h2 id="What-Happens-In-Memory"><a href="#What-Happens-In-Memory" class="headerlink" title="What Happens In Memory"></a>What Happens In Memory</h2><p>But it is what happens in memory when we use these variable types that is of interest to us. When you declare a variable that is a Value type and then assign a value to it, the memory that variable occupies holds the value you assigned to it.  The variable is just a representation of the actual value. Contrast this to a reference type.  When you new up (instantiate) a variable that is a reference type, the first thing that is happening is that memory is being allocated to hold the variables in the class and then memory is being set aside to hold a pointer to the memory we just allocated. So, with a reference type, we are only pointing to the memory we are actually using.  With a value type the variable IS the value we are using. This has implications to how the memory is used when we do assignments.</p>
<h2 id="Value-Example"><a href="#Value-Example" class="headerlink" title="Value Example"></a>Value Example</h2><p>For example, look at the code below.</p>
<p>int a = 1;<br>int b = 2;</p>
<p>a = b;</p>
<p>When we assign b to a, we are copying the value occupied by b into the memory location occupied by a.</p>
<h2 id="Reference-Example"><a href="#Reference-Example" class="headerlink" title="Reference Example"></a>Reference Example</h2><p>But what happens when we do the same thing with a reference type?</p>
<p>class Person<br>{<br>    string Name;<br>    int age;<br>}</p>
<p>var joe = new Person();<br>joe.Name = “Joe”;<br>joe.age = 23;</p>
<p>var alice = new Person();<br>alice.Name = “alice”;<br>alice.age = 33;</p>
<p>joe = alice;<br>joe.age = 50;</p>
<p>What will be the value of alice.age? You should say 50 because once we assigned alice to joe, alice and joe point to the same Person object and the Person object that alice pointed to is no longer available.</p>
<h2 id="How-About-Structs"><a href="#How-About-Structs" class="headerlink" title="How About Structs?"></a>How About Structs?</h2><p>But what happens if we make the Person class a struct instead?</p>
<p>struct Person<br>{<br>    string Name;<br>    int age;<br>}</p>
<p>Person joe;<br>joe.Name = “Joe”;<br>joe.age = 23;</p>
<p>Person alice;<br>alice.Name = “Alice”;<br>alice.age = 33;</p>
<p>joe = alice;<br>joe.age = 50;</p>
<p>Now, what is the value of alice.age? In this case, you should say that alice is still 33 because when we assigned alice to joe, joe got a copy of everything that alice had. So, joe’s name is “alice” and before we asign 50 to joe.age, joe.age holds the value of 33.  But the assignment has no impact on the value of alice.age.</p>
<h2 id="Stacks-And-Heaps"><a href="#Stacks-And-Heaps" class="headerlink" title="Stacks And Heaps"></a>Stacks And Heaps</h2><p>Now, no description of value types and reference types would be complete without some discussion of stacks and heaps. The stack is the location in memory that holds value types and reference pointers (remember I said the variable points to the memory being occupied by the value?) in your method. So when you declare a variable inside of a method that memory gets “Pushed” onto the stack. When you pass a variable to another method, that variable gets copied into a temporary variable and placed on the stack. So, doing something like</p>
<p>void Foo()<br>{<br>    int i = 23;<br>    Foo2(i);<br>}</p>
<p>void Foo2(int f)<br>{<br>   // do something with f<br>}</p>
<p>will copy 23 so that the variable f in Foo2 will not be the variable i in Foo. So if we change the value of f in Foo2 to 32, what will be the value of i when Foo2 returns? Because it is a copy, it will still be 23. The heap, on the other hand, is a location in memory that is outside of the scope of the methods we create.  So the only thing being passed around in our functions that use reference variables is pointers.  But, because they are pointers, any thing we do do a reference object inside of a method will be reflected in the variable located inside of the method that called it.</p>
<p>void Foo()<br>{<br>    var p = new Person();<br>    p.age = 24;<br>    Foo2(p);<br>}</p>
<p>void Foo2(Person person)<br>{<br>    person.age = 44;<br>}</p>
<p>So when Foo2 returns, p.age will be 44. However, if we change what person is pointing to…</p>
<p>void Foo2(Person person)<br>{<br>    person = new Person();<br>    person.age = 44;<br>}</p>
<p>p would remain unchanged and p.age would still be 24.</p>
<h2 id="Values-Inside-of-a-Class"><a href="#Values-Inside-of-a-Class" class="headerlink" title="Values Inside of a Class"></a>Values Inside of a Class</h2><p>The final question that you should be asking at this point is when I declare a value type as a member variable of my class, as I’ve done with the age variable in Person above, where is the age variable located, on the stack or on the heap? The answer to that would be it is located in the heap because it is a member of a class that is located in the heap.  And if we created another person object inside of person, the pointer would also be located in the heap and it would point to another location of the heap.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>So, today I had the task of removing the leaves from my yard, which gave me a lot of time to think because it is a pretty solitary job, even if you have people helping you, because much of the time I was using a leaf blower.  It is pretty hard to hold any kind of conversation when you are using a leaf blower.</p>
<p>And  as I was running the leaf blower, I was thinking about what I was going to talk about today.  And then it struck me, why not just talk about cleaning up the leaves?  I mean if John Sonmez and Scott Hanselman can talk about stuff that isn’t necessarily programming related, why can’t I?</p>
<p>But then I realized, I could talk about cleaning up the leaves in my yard AND talk about programming at the same time.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Rake-Leaves"><a href="#Why-Rake-Leaves" class="headerlink" title="Why Rake Leaves?"></a>Why Rake Leaves?</h2><p>Why did I clean up the leaves in my yard?  It wasn’t to make my yard look better.  No one can see my yard from the road.  No one would care but my family, and they do care.  But even if they didn’t, we ultimately clean the leaves off our yards because doing that means our grass will grow better next summer by allowing it to see the sun now.  We do it because nasty critters live in leaves.  We remove the leaves from our drive ways and sidewalks so that snow removal will be easier in the winter.  In short, as hard as the work is to take care of our leaves in the fall, the work is worth it because it makes the rest of the fall and winter easier for us  in the long run.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about the first reason, allowing the grass to get more sun during the fall months, would mean that it would actually be better to clean up the leaves frequently during the fall rather than waiting for them to all fall and then rake them.  By the time I get to them, it is probably too late to do any real good because I wait for them to all fall before I remove them.  By that time, the sun shines less during the day and the frost has already kicked in.</p>
<h2 id="How-Is-This-Related-to-Code"><a href="#How-Is-This-Related-to-Code" class="headerlink" title="How Is This Related to Code?"></a>How Is This Related to Code?</h2><p>And that brings me to our code.  We all have code that needs “raking”.  You know you have code that is duplicated all over the place, but have you taken any time to collect all of that code into one place as a function?</p>
<p>How many code smells do you have.  Are your functions long?  Do you have conditional blocks nested more than one deep?  Do you have classes that do more than one thing?  Have you written code that isn’t being used because “we might need it some day”?</p>
<p>As I work with inexperienced programmers, the one thing I notice is that looking for places to simplify code is a skill that needs to be practiced.  It doesn’t come naturally.  Very few programmers assume that as long as the code does what it should, they are done.</p>
<p>And yet, leaving these code smells in place means that the next time you go in to work on the system, you will not be able to understand the code as well as you should.  Because you haven’t let the sun shine on your code, when you get to it to maintain it, you’ll be working in mud instead of nice green grass.</p>
<h2 id="The-Challenge"><a href="#The-Challenge" class="headerlink" title="The Challenge"></a>The Challenge</h2><p>So today, your job is to find one place in your code that could be made better.  Make it less complicated.  Make it fewer lines of code (without making it hard to read).  Find two places that are doing essentially the same thing and turn that code into a function.  Find two classes that are tightly coupled (highly dependent on each other) and remove the dependencies.  Do this once a day for the next thirty days and see if you don’t find your code easier to work with than it  is today.</p>
