        <p>I recently read (yet another) post proposing that <a href="//blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericgu/2017/06/22/notdd/">TDD “doesn’t work” and that we shouldn’t use it, or should use it very little</a>.  What was shocking about this article wasn’t the content, but the fact that it is hosted on a Microsoft site. While I’m not entirely on board with throwing out TDD, the one thing I will agree to is that learning TDD is difficult.  I am also willing to admit that, to a large extent, TDD is broken.  If you’ve been following my post for a while, this SHOULD be shocking news. And so, I’ve been thinking.  Maybe we’ve been asking the wrong question.  Maybe, instead of asking “How do we encourage people to implement TDD?”  We should be asking, “How do we make TDD either unnecessary, or trivial to implement?” [caption id=”attachment_4366” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-06-27.jpg" alt="What If Unit Testing Wasn&#39;t Necessary? #noTDD" title="What If Unit Testing Wasn&#39;t Necessary? #noTDD"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/4braham/5867328365/">abraham.williams</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/0e2a0e">VisualHunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/"> CC BY-SA</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Benefits-of-TDD"><a href="#Benefits-of-TDD" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of TDD"></a>Benefits of TDD</h2><p>So, let’s review why we think TDD is a good idea.  One of the first reasons that you’ll find is that when TDD is done correctly, it encourages loose coupling of code.  In fact, one of the things that make TDD hard to learn is that our code tends to be SO tightly coupled that it can’t be tested.  There are whole books about how to decouple legacy code so we can get tests around them.  There are problems with this, but we’ll get to those in a bit. The next major benefit of TDD is that it allows us to refactor our code without worrying about breaking anything.  This is the feature I like the most.  I was working on a system recently where the requirements were being “leaked” to me a bit at a time.  I’d get something done and it would be “oh, I forgot to tell you about…”  Arrrgh.  I was able to add the new code up until the last, “Oh, I forgot…”  And that broke my whole pattern.  But it forced a much better architecture. Now in the old days, before I started writing tests, I would have been really nervous about tearing the code apart and putting it back together again.  What if I broke something that already worked?  But, because I had a large suite of tests around this code, I could refactor, run the tests, and fix the tests until I was back to everything working.  Without the tests, I would not have known that I broke anything. BTW, no one has found any bugs in this code yet and it has been almost a year since I wrote it. Related to refactoring, by having a suite of tests in place, we can be reasonably sure that, as we add new features, we aren’t breaking any existing features. Next, TDD forces, or it should force, incremental coding. I was surprised when I found out that people don’t program incrementally.  I always write just enough code to move the project along and then test it.  But I know people who write code for hours and even days before they run any of it.  And then, they can’t figure out where they broke the code.  TDD done correctly, doesn’t let this happen. And finally, once you’ve learned how to test, TDD actually increases the speed with which you can produce quality code. I know a guy who brags about how fast he can code.  But I also know he’s only counting the time until he said he was done, not the time it took him to fix all the bugs he found.  Is he really any faster than any other programmer?  It is hard to judge.  But studies have shown that using TDD leads to greater over all speed and less technical debt.  Something to consider.</p>
<h2 id="Disadvantages-of-TDD"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-TDD" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of TDD"></a>Disadvantages of TDD</h2><p>But for all of those benefits, there are still some major problems with TDD as a practice. The first, and most looming of all, is the fact that using TDD introduces A LOT of friction into the programming process.  As an exercise, I wrote a demo application using TDD while learning a new framework.  I knew the language and the testing framework, I was just learning a new programming framework.  The problem was I not only had to learn the new framework, but the framework has its own helper functions for testing that I also had to learn. I would say this friction is what holds most people back and is often voiced as, “TDD slows down my programming.”  Which is true until you’ve learned it all. The tendency with TDD is to try to get 100% code coverage.  This often lulls us into the belief that we’ve tested everything that can be tested.  But the problem is, because our code often has hidden parameters, we can’t always be sure we’ve written enough tests to be sure that we’ve covered all of the possible ways those parameters show up.  So, the fact is, we can’t be sure we have 100% coverage of the situations our code may run into even if we have 100% coverage of our code. The next two disadvantages impact relatively new programmers.  That is, people who have been programming for less than 5 years.  The problem is, that’s half of the programmers available to the market.  After 5 years, you’ve either been promoted to management where you eventually forget how to program or, at the very best only know what you knew when you were promoted, or you’ve moved on to a new career.  And then there are people like me who can’t stop coding. The problem with programmers who have less than 5 years of experience is that they don’t have any concept of design patterns and they know nothing of architecture.  And unless you work in an organization that has senior level programmers with more than 10 years of experience, you aren’t likely to know it is even something you need to learn.  And here is the problem.  It is nearly impossible to implement TDD if you don’t have a broad understanding of these two subjects.  If you have less than 5 years of experience, you are still focused on the basic problem of naming things, keeping your code DRY, and making sure you are implementing the single responsibility principle. And finally, there is simply nothing that is making you write tests.  Your code will compile and run just fine without them.  The syntax of your language really doesn’t care.  So given all the detractors, it is really easy to just not write them at all. There, I’ve said it.  Yes, we SHOULD use TDD, but it is impractical to expect any but the most seasoned programmers to use this methodology.</p>
<h2 id="What-Tests-Aren’t-Needed"><a href="#What-Tests-Aren’t-Needed" class="headerlink" title="What Tests Aren’t Needed"></a>What Tests Aren’t Needed</h2><p>But what if we could write code that didn’t need to be tested?  Well, generally any code you can look at and be sure you know what it does and what you can expect is code you don’t have to test.  Code with a cyclomatic complexity of 2 or lower, which still allows for a condition or two. Code that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small.</li>
<li>No conditions</li>
<li>No hidden parameters</li>
<li>No side effects</li>
</ul>
<p>By “small” I’m talking about code that is, ideally, 5 lines or less with the occasional 10 lines in the rarest of instances. No hidden parameters.  This is a big one.  Think about code you’ve recently written.  If you are writing Object-Oriented code, you typically have a method that takes a parameter or two (maybe more) and then accesses a member variable and may even create a new object in the middle of the function.  The reason we have Dependency Injection is to give us the ability to inject mock objects into our tests so that we can write test against something stable and known rather than these hidden parameters that are constantly changing. “No side effects” is a specific instance of a hidden parameter.  Anyone try to tests code that accesses a database?  What if all of the code you wrote that had some side effect was isolated to a specific area of your program?  In that case, it would reduce the number of tests you would need to write to just that area.  And if you wrote that code correctly, the tests would be trivial to write.</p>
<h2 id="I’ve-Fallen-in-Love-…"><a href="#I’ve-Fallen-in-Love-…" class="headerlink" title="I’ve Fallen in Love …"></a>I’ve Fallen in Love …</h2><p>And this is why I’ve fallen in love with the concepts behind Functional Programming. In Functional Programming you have a series of functions that you chain together.  Much like fluent programming in the Object-Oriented world, the return value of a function becomes the input for the next function.  Each function does just one thing, so they implement the Single Responsibility principle probably better than any class you could possibly write.  Each function only works on the parameters it has been given, so you don’t need to worry about hidden parameters and the function is not allowed to generate a side effect.  Even your conditions are handled by functions that filter the data before passing it on.  This all makes your code REALLY easy to test if you decide you need to test it at all. Of course, no one ever said we couldn’t have side effects.  Those are all isolated to specific code that is super easy to test. If this is all new to you, I suggest you take a look at the <a href="//reactivex.io/">ReactiveX</a> and start learning this library in the language of your choice. For me.  The gateway drug into the Functional world has be NgRX and the Flux/Redux pattern which is based on RxJS a JavaScript implementation of ReactiveX.</p>

        <p>Over the last couple of months, I’ve discussed specifics about Angular architecture.  Today, I want to discuss a more general question.  “Where do I put what files?” [caption id=”attachment_4360” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-06-10.jpg" alt="How to Organize an Angular Application" title="How to Organize an Angular Application"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/usmcarchives/9524920862/">Marine Corps Archives &amp; Special Collections</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/4307a6">Visual Hunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"> CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Directory-Structure"><a href="#Directory-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Directory Structure"></a>Directory Structure</h2><p>Let’s start with our general directory structure.</p>
<pre><code>app+
   + animations (holds common animation definitions)
   + components (holds common application components)
   + routes (top-level routes aka pages)
   + services (this is where you would put your services)
   + state (state management code.  One sub-directory for each reducer defined in app.stores.ts)
</code></pre><p>I use animations to transition between pages and for several locations where I expand and collapse panels.  I define the animations in the animations directory and import them into the components that need them.  Most of the sample code for animations you’ll find on the web defines the animation in the component’s TS file.  The problem with this is that it encourages redundancy. “Yeah, yeah, I’ll pull it out if I need it someplace else.” never works.  If there is even the remote possibility that you’ll need the code someplace else, break it out into its own file and import it the the file or files that need it. We’ll come back to components.  First, let’s look at routes.  You might prefer to call this directory “pages.” I call it routes.  The point is, this is where your top-level components for the routes go.  In my code, with all but the simplest of routes, my route components compose sub-components and orchestrate how data flows in and out of those sub-components.  These sub-components will either end up as sub-directories of routes or they will end up as sub-directories of components. The components directory holds dumb components that are common to two or more routes.  When we have components that are common to multiple projects, we try to break those out into separate project that we can npm install into our various projects. Next, comes the services directory.  This is where you might put any services you would create.  If you had pipes, those would go under a pipes directory, etc. Finally, the state directory.  Once again, you might prefer to call it ‘store’.  This is where our NgRX stuff goes.  One directory for each top-level entity and sub-directories under each of those for child entities.  I try to group the models, reducers, actions, and effects under the directories that represent the entities rather than having a directory for each type.  Trust me, I tried it the other way and that doesn’t work out all that well.</p>
<h2 id="Components"><a href="#Components" class="headerlink" title="Components"></a>Components</h2><p>I’ve mentioned this in previous posts, but it bears repeating.  Your top-level route component should be the only thing that knows about your NgRX store implementation.  If you have sub-components that also listen directly to the store or fire actions to it, you’re doing it wrong.  Here’s why… You never know for sure that you won’t need that same sub-component in some other place in your system working off a different set of data.  You can be sure that your route component won’t get re-used.  And besides, we need something to be responsible for managing the data. Also, components should only display the data they are given.  NO Business Rules!  I fear this will be the hardest hurdle for most of you to overcome.  And, I realized earlier today that this is a valid concern because I’ve been here before.</p>
<h2 id="Deja-Vu"><a href="#Deja-Vu" class="headerlink" title="Deja Vu"></a>Deja Vu</h2><p>A long time ago, in a galaxy not all that far away, there was a design pattern called, “Document/View.” This was a pattern that Microsoft had come up with for their C++ framework called MFC.  (Yeah, I know, I’m dating myself.)  The idea was, we would put Data stuff in the Document and the View would render the data.  This allowed us to have multiple Views looking at one Document class and the Views would render it appropriately.  It was cool little model except for the fact that people were confused about what went where.  It was clear what was presentation.  And it was reasonably clear what was data.  But there was this part of the system that no one talked about called business rules.  Where did they go? Fortunately, Document/View died.  And with NgRX and Redux, we DO have a location for our business rules.  Reducers, @Effects, or something an @Effect would call.  Keep that fixed in your brain and no one will get hurt.</p>
<h2 id="State"><a href="#State" class="headerlink" title="State"></a>State</h2><p>While I was training someone this week, the question came up about moving the State stuff under the routes because we had established a one-to-one relationship between the routes and the entities in our store.  But, that’s just how we happened to setup our project because it was a demo.  Just like with Document/View, it is entirely possible to have multiple Routes looking at the same Entity.</p>
<h2 id="Clean-Separation"><a href="#Clean-Separation" class="headerlink" title="Clean Separation"></a>Clean Separation</h2><p>The point is, we want clean separation between our presentation code, our business rules, and our data.  Having Reducers and @Effects keeps the business rules separate from our state cleanly enough.  But mixing all of that in with our presentation code is just asking for trouble.</p>
<h2 id="Functions-vs-Classes"><a href="#Functions-vs-Classes" class="headerlink" title="Functions vs Classes"></a>Functions vs Classes</h2><p>The saying goes, “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”  And no where do I see this more than with programmers coming out of an Object-Oriented programming model trying to work with JavaScript or any of the variants, especially TypeScript. The great thing about TypeScript is that it makes JavaScript FEEL a lot more like Java or C#.  The bad thing about JavaScript is that it makes it easy to forget that it isn’t Java or C#.  Here’s what I mean. I’ve seen guys create a TypeScript class so they can new up what would otherwise be an Object Literal. I’ve seen guys create a “Utils” class so they have a place to put helper functions when they could otherwise just create a TypeScript file that exported JUST that function.  BTW, this completely circumvents the whole, “what do we call this class other than Util?” problem!</p>
<h2 id="We’re-All-New-Here"><a href="#We’re-All-New-Here" class="headerlink" title="We’re All New Here"></a>We’re All New Here</h2><p>Hey!  Angular is still relatively new.  All I’m doing here is sharing my thoughts on what works and what doesn’t, based not only on my experience so far with Angular, but on my 30 years of experience programming.  What are some of the issues and best practices you’ve discovered so far?  Leave me a comment.</p>

        <p>There must be some evil plot to keep this information a secret because whenever I search for how to use RxJS Marble Testing all I see is how to use it to write tests for RxJS.  Well I’ve finally “cracked the code” In this article you’ll learn the basics of RxJS Marble Testing and how to apply Marble Testing to your own code. [caption id=”attachment_4354” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-06-13.jpg" alt="Real World RxJS Marble Testing Revealed" title="Real World RxJS Marble Testing Revealed"> Photo via <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/9662e0">Visualhunt</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="It-All-Started-When-…"><a href="#It-All-Started-When-…" class="headerlink" title="It All Started When …"></a>It All Started When …</h2><p>It all started about a month ago when I needed to write a unit test for code that updated the screen once every 15 seconds.  Writing a test that would simulate the clock moving forward 15 seconds in old school JavaScript would have been pretty easy.  But I had written my code using RxJS instead of the old school <code>setTimeout()</code> method we’ve been using for this kind of feature in the past. Specifically, I had used <code>Observable.timer(0, 15000);</code> My first attempt to write tests for this were based on the assumption that, under the hood, <code>setTimeout()</code> was still being used.  Just a simple matter of mocking the clock and advancing the timer.  Right? Wrong! Then my initial search brought me to the NgRX 4 way of writing tests for Observables.  Only, I didn’t find that out until I had written some code that didn’t work. Eventually, I found this thing called Marble Testing.  But, as I’ve already mentioned, all of the examples I’ve found for how to write test are for written test for the various methods available in the RxJS library. I’m guess, if you are still reading, I’ve described your journey as well.</p>
<h2 id="Assumptions"><a href="#Assumptions" class="headerlink" title="Assumptions"></a>Assumptions</h2><p>For the remainder of this article, I’m going to assume you know how to use RxJS.  If you don’t there is already a lot of good information available on that topic that you should easily be able to find by using one of the search engines. I’m also going to describe how to use marbles in your tests using Jasmine.  I use Jasmine because that is the engine all of the frameworks that I use end up using.  There are other tools that may or may not be better.  But I have no reason to leave what everyone else has already picked as a defacto standard.</p>
<h2 id="Marble-Basics"><a href="#Marble-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Marble Basics"></a>Marble Basics</h2><p>Since there is a lot of detail on the basics of using Marbles, I only plan on summarizing what you need to know here.

<h3 id="Create-Observables"><a href="#Create-Observables" class="headerlink" title="Create Observables"></a>Create Observables</h3><p>First, you can create either hot observables or cold observables.  To do this, you’ll need to create an instance of <code>TestScheduler</code> and then you call either <code>createHotObservable()</code> or <code>createColdObservable()</code> passing a string that defines what you want your observables to do. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/05066ff3181cfd98fbbb966ac431ecc6#file-create-observable-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/05066ff3181cfd98fbbb966ac431ecc6#file-create-observable-ts</a></p>
<h3 id="Marble-Syntax"><a href="#Marble-Syntax" class="headerlink" title="Marble Syntax"></a>Marble Syntax</h3><ul>
<li><code>&quot;-&quot;</code> time: 10 “frames” of time passage.</li>
<li><code>&quot;|&quot;</code> complete: The successful completion of an observable. This is the observable producer signaling <code>complete()</code></li>
<li><code>&quot;#&quot;</code> error: An error terminating the observable. This is the observable producer signaling <code>error()</code></li>
<li><code>&quot;a&quot;</code> any character: All other characters represent a value being emitted by the producer signaling <code>next()</code></li>
<li><code>&quot;()&quot;</code> sync groupings: When multiple events need to single in the same frame synchronously, parenthesis are used to group those events. You can group next values, a completion or an error in this manner. The position of the initial <code>(</code>determines the time at which its values are emitted.</li>
<li><code>&quot;^&quot;</code> subscription point: (hot observables only) shows the point at which the tested observables will be subscribed to the hot observable. This is the “zero frame” for that observable, every frame before the <code>^</code> will be negative.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most simple of observables using marbles would look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/05066ff3181cfd98fbbb966ac431ecc6#file-simple-observable-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/05066ff3181cfd98fbbb966ac431ecc6#file-simple-observable-ts</a> This would cause an observable event to fire right away and it would pass “a” as the data for the observable.  The observable would then end because the | comes next. In the case of the timer I was testing, I don’t need the data, I just need the “event” to fire so my code runs.</p>
<h2 id="Marbles-as-Mocks"><a href="#Marbles-as-Mocks" class="headerlink" title="Marbles as Mocks"></a>Marbles as Mocks</h2><p>So far, I probably haven’t told you anything that you couldn’t already figure out by doing a basic search.  But, the question remains, how do we use this marble stuff in our own test? And the answer that no one seems to be talking about is that you use marbles to mock out the real observable just like you might create a mock object to replace a real object in any other test. In the case of the timer problem above, what I needed to do was to make sure that <code>Observable.timer(0, 15000);</code> returns an observable that was created with a marble instead of an observable created with the timer.  In Jasmine, we do that with <code>spyOn()</code> <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/05066ff3181cfd98fbbb966ac431ecc6#file-spy-on-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/05066ff3181cfd98fbbb966ac431ecc6#file-spy-on-ts</a> The rest of your code really doesn’t care what kind of observable it is, it will do whatever it is it has been coded to do. The only thing you need to do to make sure the observable and subscribes do their thing is to make sure you call <code>flush()</code> on the <code>TestScheduler</code> instance prior to running an <code>expect()</code> in your Jasmine test.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Uses"><a href="#Other-Uses" class="headerlink" title="Other Uses"></a>Other Uses</h2><p>What I’ve shown so far takes care of my 15 second refresh issue.  But now, what if I have an observable that expects data?  For example, how would I write a test that uses an observable based on an AJAX request as a dependency?  In Angular, this would be Http. This is actually very simple.  The second parameter to either <code>createHotObservable()</code> or <code>createColdObservable()</code> is the data you want to send on to the subscribe when it hits the associated marble.  You pass this in as an object literal.  So, just to keep things simple.  Say that when you hit the “a” marble, you want to pass the subscribe an object that has a first name and a last name.  Your code might look something like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/05066ff3181cfd98fbbb966ac431ecc6#file-observable-with-data-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/05066ff3181cfd98fbbb966ac431ecc6#file-observable-with-data-ts</a> By using this type of marble mocking, you could not just create unit tests, but you could also create End to End tests that use marbles to return consistent data rather than hitting the back end.  Obviously, you would still need to write tests that ensure your back end is going to return the same type of data, but I see that as a separate issue from ensuring that the front end does everything it should do as a system.  Anyhow, it is an option.</p>

        <p>Maybe this is all obvious to you, but since I don’t see anyone talking about this when I search for “how to do NgRX” or the various variants, I thought I’d call it out in this weeks post. If you haven’t been following along, you’ll want to review <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/tag/ngrx/">my previous posts on NgRX</a>. [caption id=”attachment_4348” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-06-06.jpg" alt="NgRX/Store Coding Sanity Epiphany" title="NgRX/Store Coding Sanity Epiphany"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/spcbrass/394867154/">spcbrass</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/cff786">Visual Hunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/"> CC BY-SA</a>[/caption]  If it isn’t clear yet, I’m still sorting out a lot of this Angular/Redux/NgRX stuff.  But as I was working on my current project this week, I realized I have WAY too much code in my presentation layer.</p>
<h2 id="The-Epiphany"><a href="#The-Epiphany" class="headerlink" title="The Epiphany"></a>The Epiphany</h2><p>I have two main screens I’m working on.  As you read the articles on the Internet that explain how to use this pattern or the Redux pattern it was derived from, you’ll quickly learn that you want to work with a “Smart Component.”  This component is kind of a traffic cop.  It uses observables to listen to state change in your Store and it sends actions to, primarily, update the database and change the store’s state.  From what I’ve been able to gather, the expectation is that a lot of the logic that would be needed to actually process the data is going to go in this smart component.  The first screen I worked on, followed this basic pattern.  This put a whole crap load of code in my smart component. On the second page, I kind of stumbled onto what I believe is a cleaner model.  I realized that I was hanging onto data in my smart component that was also in my store.  That seems kind of dumb.  If all I need is in my store, why not just fire off an action to do whatever it is I want to do and have the @Effect grab the data from the store? This is why I ended up making my smart component listen to the observables and dispatch events to the store based on changes in my components.  This includes things like button clicks.  Any other processing that needs to take place takes place in either an @Effect or is called from an @Effect. I can’t describe for you how much cleaner my codebase is as a result!  WOW! But, will it work on the first page the same as it works on the second page?</p>
<h2 id="The-Test"><a href="#The-Test" class="headerlink" title="The Test"></a>The Test</h2><p>You see, this is a big difference between the first page and the second page.  The first page is basically a search and list page.  The second page is an edit page for an item.  On the first page, I had multiple store entities for the various parts.  I had an entity for the search fields.  An entity for the search results. And others.  Let’s just say my model isn’t very flat. The fact of the matter is, the second page that I created wasn’t really all that flat either.  But because I started with the concept of not putting any logic in my smart component, it felt easier to manage. So, the first thing I wanted to do was to create a reducer for the page.  All this reducer will do is distribute the action down into sub-reducers.  This allowed me to keep all of my action code the same.  The only thing that changes is that the directories for my sub-reducers and the @Effects, Actions and Models (interfaces) that are associated with them go under my directory for my main Reducer and Model. I still have a bit of code that I’d like to clean up, but on the whole, I like this pattern much better than what I was doing before.</p>
<h2 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h2><p>The main advantage to using this new architecture is that it simplifies and reduces testing considerations. For example, because all my presentation layer is now doing is either reflecting the state that is in my store or telling my store to do something, there really isn’t much, if anything, left to test in my presentation layer.  If you’ve written your code correctly, none of the methods in your view should have a cyclomatic complexity of greater than two.  You may still want to write some end-to-end tests to make sure that the NgRX/Store loop is working correctly.  But that is an entirely different subject. This does not mean that we don’t have to test anything.  All of that code had to go some place, right? But, here’s the deal.  Because the code is in an @Effect or a Service (generally) your tests become much more simple.  You might have to dummy up a store or a service.  But for the most part, your tests won’t really look much different that tests you would write for regular JavaScript code without a framework. The other HUGE advantage to using this architecture is that it allows you to distribute your code so that no file is too large and hard to reason about.  It allow you to follow the “Single Responsibility Principle” in greater granularity than you might otherwise be able to do. And finally, this architecture allows you to treat all of the component code: the html template, the CSS, and the TypeScript file, as all View code.  And I think this is where many people are confused about Angular.</p>
<h2 id="View-Confusion"><a href="#View-Confusion" class="headerlink" title="View Confusion"></a>View Confusion</h2><p>In a MVC or even an MVVM pattern, we’ve also considered the HTML template the “View” and the JavaScript (or in our case, TypeScript) code the controller.  This is a common misconception that I believe the ASP.NET crowd still gets wrong.  Code-behind code isn’t your controller.  It is helper code for your View.  And so, we end up putting processing code in our view, when it really belongs in an entirely different file.  This is what the Model View Presenter pattern solves.  If you aren’t going to use NgRX and Reactive Forms, you should check out MVP as a way of architecting your code using the older Template Driven Forms approach that was common in AngularJS.</p>
<h2 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code"></a>Code</h2><p>For the purposes of this article, I’m going to assume you’ve read my other articles which I’ve linked to at the beginning of this post. So first, the basic directory and file structure of this new method might look something like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-directory-structure-txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-directory-structure-txt</a> Some things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Actions are defined in the target.  You would seldom, if ever, define an action at the route level.</li>
<li>Effects are optional, just like any other time you would use them.</li>
<li>Effects are seldom, if ever, defined at the route level.</li>
<li>I’m using “route1” etc and “sub-reducer1” etc as sample names.  Use names that represent your route names and the data you are storing.</li>
<li>The only reducers that gets defined in our app.store.ts file are the reducers in the route directories.</li>
<li>You still need to register each of your effects in app.store.ts as you have been doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next thing that is probably not clear is that your top level model, ie “route1.model.ts” should only hold the sub-reducers.  I’ve also found it useful to make all of my top level properties optional. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-route1-model-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-route1-model-ts</a> And this is used in your route reducer as: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-route1-reducer-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-route1-reducer-ts</a> Now, the trick we need to implement is that we need to delegate the actions down to the appropriate reducers and we only want to change the state object to a new object if a child state has changed. In the top level reducer, you need to put code that looks something like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-route1-reducerb-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-route1-reducerb-ts</a> The key here is that you want the property names in the reducerList to be the same name as what is in the Route1Model and you want the values assigned to them to be the function pointer (notice, no parenthesis) that should be called. The actual sub-reducers look like a regular reducer.  The only real difference is that you will be calling the function that returns the state, the second export statement we normally put in our reducers that returns the ActionReducer&lt;&gt; is not needed. So, our Object.keys().map() processes each reducer and updates the parent object if the child has changed. Now, by way of reminder.  You can observe all of the store, or part of the store.  So, your smart component might observe just a sub entity or the whole entity depending on the need at the moment. Finally, lets say you want to have a “Save” button that causes the information in your store to be persisted to a database.  You would place a method in your smart component that gets triggered by the button and fires a “Save” action to an @Effect. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-save-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-save-ts</a> Your @effect will respond, and since @Effects typically already have a store injected into them, you can use the store to retrieve the data. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-effect-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/b79c333224340b6a9d96ed719b116112#file-effect-ts</a> Notice that since we are doing our own dispatching inside of a subscribe() we return {type: ‘noop’} from the @Effect.  This is because ALL @Effects MUST return an Action unless they have been turned off in the constructor.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Well, that’s the basic idea.  What do you think?  Leave me a comment.</p>

        <p>Over the last month or so, I’ve been presenting the basics of <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/tag/ngrx/">how to use NgRX/Store with Angular</a>.  In the past, I’ve praised the virtues of <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/tag/reactive-forms/">Reactive Forms</a>, also known as <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/tag/model-driven/">Model Driven Forms</a>.  These along with RxJS make up the pillars of Functional Reactive Angular Programming. What is sad is that this reality is lost on so much of the Angular community.  When I listen to podcast where they talk about any of these concepts individually, Function Reactive Programming (FRP) is barely, if ever, mentioned. But the scary thing is this, there are many people who are going to use the new Angular the way they used the old Angular and they will completely miss the main advantages.  They may even jump from Angular to React or (even) Aurelia.  And that’s just picking on the most recent frameworks.  Some will want to go back to Egypt and decide jQuery is a good choice! Functional Reactive Programming is not just a hot new model.  It solves a lot of problems.

<h2 id="Object-Oriented-Failure"><a href="#Object-Oriented-Failure" class="headerlink" title="Object-Oriented Failure"></a>Object-Oriented Failure</h2><p>Several years ago, I wrote an article called, “<a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/object-oriented-programming-has-failed-us/">Object-Oriented Programming Has Failed Us</a>”.  In the article, I put forth the reality that most people are unable to think in object-oriented terms.  Humans think sequentially and chunk down.  Object-Oriented Programming requires us to think holistically, frequently in parallel, and chunk up. So, lets define some terms.  Chunking down is the act of finding differences between things.  This is why we discriminate.  At times, it is useful to find differences.  If you are a microbiologist, you want to do this so you know you are working with one strain of virus vs some other strain. As you might have guessed, Chunking Up, is the exact opposite.  We look for commonalities.  Given two different things, what is the same between them? The problem is, that’s not how most of us naturally process the world. There are other problems with Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
<h3 id="Hard-to-Reason-About"><a href="#Hard-to-Reason-About" class="headerlink" title="Hard to Reason About"></a>Hard to Reason About</h3><p>Back when I was teaching for a training company, I was explaining some concept of Object-Oriented Programming, probably Virtual Functions, to a student that came from a procedural programming world.  His comment was, “this is going to make the code really hard to debug!” to which I responded, “not if you step through with the debugger.”  But, the truth is, he was right.  Debugging Object-Oriented code is difficult because the code is hard to read and reason about.  Looking at any one class, am ever sure that I’m seeing the whole picture? Think about this.  When you write a class, and have a member variable, how long is it before you’ve forgotten the fact that the variable exists and is implicitly a parameter that is being passed to your function.  Not long!  And this means that you can never really be sure that when you go to use that function, the state of the object will always be the same. This makes the code incredibly hard to test.  I’m not even talking about using Test Driven Development.  Just any kind of test that have way ensures that the code you’ve written does what you think it does and doesn’t do what you don’t think it does.</p>
<h3 id="Single-Responsibility"><a href="#Single-Responsibility" class="headerlink" title="Single Responsibility"></a>Single Responsibility</h3><p>One of the rules for Object-Oriented Programming is that we should follow the “Single Responsibility Principle” I ask you, how far do we chunk down to ensure we are only doing one thing in our class?  In fact, many of the principles we have developed are trying to put fences around the inherent problems with programming in an Object-Oriented mindset.</p>
<h2 id="Procedural-Programming"><a href="#Procedural-Programming" class="headerlink" title="Procedural Programming"></a>Procedural Programming</h2><p>The benefit of Procedural Programming is that I at least knew what parameters I was always going to get.  The disadvantage is that it was still incredibly hard to test because my function could call other function that could call yet other functions.  This meant that I could only really test the functions that were at the end of the hierarchy and really had no good way of mocking out child functions.  While testing is hard in an Object-Oriented world, it is nearly impossible in a procedural world.</p>
<h1 id="What-If"><a href="#What-If" class="headerlink" title="What If"></a>What If</h1><p>But, what if there were a way to write code that solved most of these problems.  A way that better mirrored how we thought, that is easier to reason about, that allows you to chunk down – that forced you to chunk down.  A way of coding that was so easy to test, that you frequently didn’t even need to write the test.  This is the advantage of Functional Programming generally, and the reason you want to use the combination of NgRX/Store, Reactive Forms, and RxJS in the bulk of your Angular code.</p>
<h2 id="How-To"><a href="#How-To" class="headerlink" title="How To"></a>How To</h2><h3 id="Basics"><a href="#Basics" class="headerlink" title="Basics"></a>Basics</h3><p>You’ll remember from our discussion of NgRX that we setup a reducer to return a new state object for a particular entity in our store.  You’ll also remember that we are able to create an entity that has child entities and that we can subscribe to any entity using code that looks something like this: <code>store.select(x =&gt; x.entityName)</code> or <code>store.select(x =&gt; x.entityName.subEntity)</code> If you need to, you can read my previous articles that I’ve already referred to. I normally setup an entity in my store for each screen, then for data I am just displaying I subscribe in the template using <code>{ {(observerThing | async)?.variableThing}}</code>. The <code>(observerThing | async)</code> is the same as the code we would normally write in TypeScript: <code>observerThing.subscribe(x =&gt; x);</code> <code>async</code> does the <code>subscribe</code> and returns <code>x</code>.  The <code>?</code> ensures that we don’t attempt to go after <code>.variableThing</code> if <code>x</code> is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>. This is all pretty basic stuff. But what about working with forms.</p>
<h3 id="Forms"><a href="#Forms" class="headerlink" title="Forms"></a>Forms</h3><p>I’ve found that the best way to work with forms is to create a structure in my entity that maps directly to my form.  So, if I have a form with firstName, lastName, and birthDate, I’ll define my form in my template with a form group using firstName, lastName, and birthDate as formControlName values. Next, in my TypeScript code, I’ll subscribe to the form group’s valueChanges property.  Any time my form changes, the subscribe dispatches the changes to the reducer for my entity and updates the store. <code>this.myFormGroup.valueChanges.subscribe(x =&gt; store.dispatch(/* action thing goes here */))</code> Similarly, I can setup a <code>subscribe</code> on my entity and any time the data in the entity changes, I can update the form group. There is a small little trick you need to know about here.  I already showed you how to update the form group using <code>patchValue()</code> <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/angular2-model-driven-forms-are-superior/">here</a>.  But because we were not dealing with a fully Functional Reactive programming model, I left out a part you’ll need here. When you update your code using <code>patchValue()</code>, the first parameter will still be the data you want to change.  That is, the values from the store’s entity.  But for the second parameter, you’ll need to pass in <code>{emitEvent: false}</code>, otherwise, you’ll end up with an infinite loop.  Your form will cause your reducer to change and your store will cause your form to change.  What that second parameter is saying is that we don’t want any of the change events to fire because we’ve updated the form. You may also want to consider writing code in your reducer that only returns a new state object if no data has changed.</p>
<h3 id="RxJS"><a href="#RxJS" class="headerlink" title="RxJS"></a>RxJS</h3><p>Now, nothing about anything I’ve written in the “how to” is particularly Functional, but it is Reactive.  By virtue of the subscribes, it is reacting to state change and reacting to changes in the form.  What makes our code Functional, is that we make use of RxJS, a Reactive library, to process the data.  If you’ve already been using the Http object in Angular, you’ve already been using RxJS. There is a great <a href="//reactivex.io/learnrx/">tutorial for learning RxJS</a> that the guys at NetFlix have put together.  I’m not even going to attempt to teach RxJS here.  They’ve got the best material and it is what helped me wrap my head around the basic concepts. What I do want to point out here is what makes Functional programming Functional so that you end up using RxJS correctly.  While these are not hard and fast rules, I would encourage you to break these rules only after you can’t find any other way:</p>
<ol>
<li>The output of one function becomes the input for the next function.</li>
<li>A function never causes a side effect (this is why NgRX has Effects)</li>
<li>The same parameters in will always produce the same data out.</li>
<li>Avoid conditionals and use .filter(), .case() etc instead.</li>
<li>Ideally the cyclomatic complexity of a function should be 1</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these rules, you will find that most of the code you write doesn’t need to have any test.  Why would you ever test a function with a cyclomatic complexity of 1, or code that has no conditions?</p>
<h2 id="The-Right-Tool-for-the-Job"><a href="#The-Right-Tool-for-the-Job" class="headerlink" title="The Right Tool for the Job"></a>The Right Tool for the Job</h2><p>While I would love to be able to use Functional programming everywhere, I recognize that it isn’t always the best tool for the job.  For example, at least with Angular, there isn’t a good way of writing our components and pages in a strictly Functional way.  However, if you use what I’ve illustrated here, you’ll find that even though the structure of your components are Object-Oriented, much of the code within the component is quite functional.</p>

        <p>This past week I was talking to a guy who is graduating from College and looking for a job.  He asked me what most people ask at that point in their career.  “Everyone wants experience, but how do you get experience if no one will give it to you?” What is interesting is that for all the advances in the 30 years since I started my career, that question is still the main question every graduate asks. Now, before I get started, I want to make sure we are clear.  These tips may or may not work for you.  They are what I would do, and in large part are what I did 30 years ago, just updated to be appropriate to the current technology.  How well they work for you are going to depend on a lot of different factors, not least of which is how much effort you apply.  They are also very much based on my culture here in the USA.  If you are looking for a job in another country that is dissimilar culturally, you may want to ignore this advice completely.  But, I’ll also say this.  If what you are currently doing isn’t working, what do you have to lose?

<h2 id="Get-a-Job"><a href="#Get-a-Job" class="headerlink" title="Get a Job"></a>Get a Job</h2><p>Wait!  Wasn’t the whole point of this article to help you find a job?  No! The point of this article is help you get a Programming job.  And the first step in the process is to get A job.  Any job.  Don’t be picky.  When I started my career, I was working in the Sporting Goods and Automotive department at K-Mart.  Minimum wage.  Nothing to write home about.  Prior to that I worked as a maintenance man. Listen, I know you want a job in whatever it was you went to school for.  But the fact of the matter is, you have college bills to pay off.  You probably have a car that needs gas and insurance.  You may even have rent and groceries.  If Mom and Dad are taking care of all that for you, shame on them!  And shame on you for letting them, no matter how easy that makes life.  Cut the cord and grow up! OK, enough on that rant. If I can’t convince you on the financial terms, let me try a couple other really good reasons. First, the fact of the matter is, no one wants to be the first one to take a chance on you.  If you don’t currently have a job that you’ve been able to hold for a while, how can I be sure that you will work out?  Even if you have all the credentials I’m looking for, will you stick around when things get hard?  Getting a job, particularly a crappy job, shows that you are a worker.  That nothing is beneath you.  And trust me, with all the stories about how millennials are lazy and want the world handed to them (even if that isn’t totally accurate) you can bet someone who is working for minimum wage at a job that don’t particularly like is going to stand out.</p>
<h2 id="Your-Job-is-Getting-a-Job"><a href="#Your-Job-is-Getting-a-Job" class="headerlink" title="Your Job is Getting a Job"></a>Your Job is Getting a Job</h2><p>Until you have a job of some kind, your job is getting a job.  The harder you work at getting a job, the faster you will get the job you want.  This means you should have a list of things you can do today that will get you closer to landing a job.  Work on your resume.  Implement some of the tips below.  Apply for any and every job that is open.  Go door to door if you have to. Once you’ve finished reading this article, make a list and work through it.</p>
<h2 id="It’s-a-Numbers-Game"><a href="#It’s-a-Numbers-Game" class="headerlink" title="It’s a Numbers Game"></a>It’s a Numbers Game</h2><p>Now here is a very sad truth.  Getting that first job is a numbers game.  You are going to apply to a lot of places before anyone hires you.  And the thing your college won’t tell you as they prepare you to get out into the real world is just how much work this is going to be. When I was your age… … we just had the newspaper.  I sent my resume to anyone and everyone that looked like they might have a programming job available. In your case, you are going to make sure you are as visible as possible.  Post your resume on job boards.  Apply to every company that has an open computer job, even if you don’t qualify for the one they advertised.  As your friends if they know anyone who might be able to help. Note: I said, “might be able to help.”  Not, “might be able to get you a job.”  I’ll talk more about this later.  But HOW you ask for help plays a HUGE part in being able to GET help. When someone ask you what you do, the answer is, “Well, actually, right now I’m trying to find a job as a … do you know anyone who might be able to help?” It is the whole networking thing. Allow me to tell you a story.  When I graduated, this was the exact line I used.  “Do you know anyone who might be able to help?”  And when I contacted the person I was referred to, I asked the same question.  Typically, the letter I sent looked something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear sir, I just graduated from such and such college/university.  My degree is in X and I’m trying to find work. I was speaking with John Doe who suggested that I contact you.  I realize you may or may not have anything for me, but I was hoping you might be able to suggest some people who might be able to help me find an entry level programming position. Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Your-Degree-isn’t-Primary"><a href="#Your-Degree-isn’t-Primary" class="headerlink" title="Your Degree isn’t Primary"></a>Your Degree isn’t Primary</h2><p>I know your degree is probably all you feel like you have.  But mostly, no one cares.  Oh, we care that you have a degree, but that is about all. What do we care about? What can you do? Now, what you need to do is think outside the box.  When you put your resume together, you are going to put anything on your resume that is remotely related to the kind of job you are trying to get.  Even if you did it for free. The next best thing you can do is to put something on your resume that indicates you are a go-getter.  Did you have any leadership roles in college?  Make sure that gets on your resume!  Have you done a lot of volunteer work?</p>
<h2 id="Dress-Up"><a href="#Dress-Up" class="headerlink" title="Dress Up"></a>Dress Up</h2><p>Really!  This shouldn’t need to be said.  But unless you are told otherwise ahead of time, you never get in trouble for dressing up for an interview.  But nothing will kill it faster if you don’t.  Yes, even in this modern day and age.  Even if the organization sells itself as a casual organization, dress in business attire.  Guys, this means where a suit.  Gals, let’s face it, I doubt you’ll have any problem with this.</p>
<h2 id="LinkedIn"><a href="#LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2><p>I wrote about <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/linkedin-tips-for-programmers/">my LinkedIn strategy</a> a while ago.  As I stated there, the more connections you have, the better off you will be.  This is true of all social media.  Connect to anyone who ask to connect with you. Your LinkedIn connections are a large field of people you can send a version of the letter above.  Remember, you aren’t asking them for work, you are asking for help finding work. Which leads to a little rant I have built up about how to ask for help.</p>
<h2 id="Asking-for-Help"><a href="#Asking-for-Help" class="headerlink" title="Asking for Help"></a>Asking for Help</h2><p>This time of year, I get multiple in-Mails that all say essentially the same thing.  “Hi, I am graduating from X with a degree in Y.  Let me know if you have any work.”  Oh, yes, they use a few more words than that.  But the gist is exactly that short little sentence. Now, imagine you are me and everyone sends you that same in-Mail.  What would you do?  Probably the same thing I do.  Delete it. Occasionally, I’ll get some sort of variation that amounts to exactly what I’ve been saying.  “I was hoping I could talk to you about …” Why does this work when the other way doesn’t.  Simple, you aren’t asking me for work.  You are asking for advice. If you want to get help, you need to stand out.  If you ask me for advice and I have a job for you, I’ll let you know.  If all you do is ask for a job… “Delete” This, of course, doesn’t always work.  But, this is exactly how I got my first job. Now, if you follow the advice I’ve given so far, eventually, you’ll find a job.  But there is a lot more you can do that will make you stand out.</p>
<h2 id="Volunteer"><a href="#Volunteer" class="headerlink" title="Volunteer"></a>Volunteer</h2><p>Hey, you aren’t doing anything yet anyhow.  If you took my advice and have a minimum wage job, you still have some brain power left.  So, find some organization that needs help with what you want to do and volunteer.  Now you have experience you can put on your resume and the organization has some program that helps them along.</p>
<h2 id="Stack-Overflow"><a href="#Stack-Overflow" class="headerlink" title="Stack Overflow"></a>Stack Overflow</h2><p>Another place you can gain some points is on Stack Overflow.  Answer question.  The fastest way to learn is to find a question that no one has answered.  Figure out the answer and post it.  If you do one question a day, your points will rise and you can include a link to your profile as part of your resume.</p>
<h2 id="Open-Source"><a href="#Open-Source" class="headerlink" title="Open Source"></a>Open Source</h2><p>Regardless of the type of work you want, participating in an Open Source project is another way of showing that you know your stuff.  You might think you need to know a lot to participate in a project.  But there are some low entry ways of participating. An easy way to get started is by visiting these sites and finding some low hanging fruit that will get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//up-for-grabs.net/#/">Up for Grabs</a> – A list of sites looks for help from new contributors.  Easy way to get started.</li>
<li><a href="//github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners">Awesome for Beginners</a> – List of beginner friendly projects</li>
<li><a href="//medium.freecodecamp.com/finding-your-first-open-source-project-or-bug-to-work-on-1712f651e5ba">Check Out this Post</a> – Even more ways to get started</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Your-Resume"><a href="#Your-Resume" class="headerlink" title="Your Resume"></a>Your Resume</h2><p>I wrote about <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/your-programming-resume-is-garbage/">how I think a Resume should be put together</a> before.  Read it and implement it. Two things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to stand out.</li>
<li>The how-to class your college gave you is useless.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Job-Boards"><a href="#Job-Boards" class="headerlink" title="Job Boards"></a>Job Boards</h2><p>You can post your resume to all the job boards if you like.  But the only one I bother with is Dice.com because it is the only one I know of that is focused on what we do.</p>
<h2 id="The-Interview"><a href="#The-Interview" class="headerlink" title="The Interview"></a>The Interview</h2><p>Once again, I’ve <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/category/interview/">written about the interview process</a> before too. But here I want to talk to the new programmer specifically. First, no one expects you to have all the answers.  If you don’t know, just say so.  Don’t try to bluff you way through.  They will find out you don’t know eventually.  But more importantly, saying “I don’t know.”  Means you really do know the stuff you’ve given an answer for. Second, while hardly anyone in this field wants to admit it, the interview is about interpersonal skills.  A lot of the time, if you <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/confident-programmer-secrets-revealed/">act confident in yourself</a>, they will be confident in you. Learn body language, power poses, etc. I was just thinking about this more today and realized … what’s the one thing most people want?  They want to be liked.  They want people to be interested in them.  Sure, there are a lot of hacks I could tell you.  But the simplest, and most genuine hack of all is to be interested in your interviewer. You know that part of the interview where they ask you if you have any questions?  This is where you ask question that show you know something about the job you are interviewing for.  But, you can also use this to ask a question that is both about the job and the person interviewing.  Like, “What is your favorite part of working here?”  and “What is your least favorite …”  You find out something about the organization and you get them talking about something that is important to them.</p>
<h2 id="Bet-on-Yourself"><a href="#Bet-on-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Bet on Yourself"></a>Bet on Yourself</h2><p>As a last resort.  Bet on yourself.  “I’ll work for you for free for 3 months to prove to you you want to hire me full-time.”  Even if things don’t work out, you’ve gotten more experience.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This week, I want to demonstrate some ways you might use NgRX in your own code.</p>
<h2 id="Review"><a href="#Review" class="headerlink" title="Review"></a>Review</h2><p>Last week we went into a lot of detail about how the NgRX system should be wired together.  Here is all of that in picture form. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/image.png" alt="image" title="image">  A component fires an event to either an effect or a reducer using an action.  If an effect was called, it fires another action which is normally picked up by a reducer.  The Reducer mutates the state which then gets placed in the store.  “Magic happens here.”  You don’t write any code to get it to the store other than that you create a reducer.  Anything that is observing the table in the store that got changed will get notified via RxJS observables and the cycle is complete. Note that the action you dispatch can be handled by either an Effect, a Reducer or both.</p>
<h2 id="Basic-CRUD"><a href="#Basic-CRUD" class="headerlink" title="Basic CRUD"></a>Basic CRUD</h2><p>Most of the time, we think of NgRX as a way of handling CRUD operations.  We need to see the current record so we fire off a LOAD action that uses an effect to retrieve the data from the database.  Once the data comes back, we return an action that tells the reducer to put that new data into the store.  Since our component is observing the store, it updates the screen with the new values. If we need to add a record, we fire an ADD action.  If we need to delete we fire a DELETE action.  If we need to update, we fire an UPDATE action.  Each of these are picked up by the Effect, which then fires an action that places new state information in the store via the Reducer.</p>
<h2 id="Wait-State"><a href="#Wait-State" class="headerlink" title="Wait State"></a>Wait State</h2><p>When most people think of how to use NgRX or any similar pattern, they immediately think of the CRUD pattern I mentioned above.  But, we don’t have to start the Action chain from a component.  For that matter, we don’t have to listen to our Store data from a component either. One way I’ve implemented NgRX that solves a lot of common issues is that I’ve created a wait state component that shows when a count variable has been incremented and doesn’t show when the count is zero.  Since Store is Injectable, I can increment and decrement the count from just about anywhere.  Most often I increment it from an effect just before I make an AJAX call and decrement it in a finally() block of the Http observable.  I have a start() action that increments the count and an end() action that decrements the count and ensures that I never go below zero.  I can start off multiple asynchronous processes which will all increment the counter and decrement the counter appropriately.  The wait state GUI displays until everything has finished. This is OH! So much easier than how we’ve had to handle this problem with other design patterns.  I’m not saying it couldn’t be done, or that it was even particularly hard.  But this way is easier.</p>
<h2 id="Error-Handling"><a href="#Error-Handling" class="headerlink" title="Error Handling"></a>Error Handling</h2><p>Another place where you might want to present information but trigger the display from just about anywhere is with error handling.  In the code I work on, I have a modal popup component that displays whenever my error collection has something in it.  Anytime I need to display an error, I add the error to the collection via an Action and it magically displays.  The great thing about this mechanism is that regardless of how many errors I send to the collection, they all display until I close the window, which clears out the collection.</p>
<h2 id="Page-State"><a href="#Page-State" class="headerlink" title="Page State"></a>Page State</h2><p>Most page state is handled by the fact that we’ve stored the data into a database.  But there are times when we want to come back to a page we had been working on previously and we want it to display with the data that was on it at the time we left. Or maybe you want to work on a series of pages prior to saving so that everything gets saved as a set. No matter.  You can use NgRX to store everything into the store and a separate action can trigger an effect that pushes that data to the database. Or, as is the case in an application I’m working on, I’m using a form to search a database.  When I come back, I want the same search fields and I want the search to reinitialized.  In my particular case, I don’t have a search field.  You change a field, a new search is automatically initiated. This case is just a little bit more complicated than what we’ve looked at so far. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/image-1.png" alt="image" title="image">   In order to keep the state information available so that it is there when I come back to it, I need to store that information in the search table via the Search Reducer.  So, every time something changes in the Search Form, I send off an action to the Search Reducer so that the change can be recorded. Meanwhile, the Search Form also is listening to the Search Table so that when it comes back it can put the changes in the form, and it can send an action to the Search Results Reducer telling it to search for the information.  When it gets the results, the Search Results Table picks them up and since the Search Results Component is listening to the Search Results Table, they display. If I leave the page, the Search Form grabs the current search parameters from the Search Table and Fills the Form and sends the action to the Search Results Reducer and the page is back where we left it.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The point is, NgRX isn’t just about basic CRUD forms and because there are multiple ways you can mix and match the parts, even your basic CRUD implementation has a lot more flexibility than you might be used to.</p>

        <p>If you are programming in Angular and haven’t tried Model Driven Forms yet, I’m assuming that is because you’ve not taken the time to try to learn it.  In this article, I am going to try to convince you that the Model Driven Form based approach is superior to Template Driven Forms and that the only people that are still using Template Driven Forms are people who either have not been enlightened or lazy.

<h2 id="What-are-Template-Driven-Forms"><a href="#What-are-Template-Driven-Forms" class="headerlink" title="What are Template Driven Forms"></a>What are Template Driven Forms</h2><p>For those who aren’t already familiar with the terms, let’s define them first.  A template driven form is an Angular form that has most of the form logic in the template code.  The elements that give away the fact that we are working with a template driven form are that we are using ngModel in our form fields, all of our form fields have a name attribute, and our form has ngForm declared as assigned to the form variable. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/58c2d6bf41fdb255e4582f35134665a1#file-template-form-html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/58c2d6bf41fdb255e4582f35134665a1#file-template-form-html</a> In our code, each form field is handled individually.  While we might bind them all to a structure of some sort in our TypeScript code, the result is we continue to think of the data as parts rather than wholes.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-Model-Driven-Forms"><a href="#What-are-Model-Driven-Forms" class="headerlink" title="What are Model Driven Forms"></a>What are Model Driven Forms</h2><p>Model Driven Forms, on the other hand, put a minimal amount of information in the template.  It isn’t that we eliminate the template completely, we just put more of the responsibility into the TypeScript code. Typical template code for Model Driven Forms looks like this <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/58c2d6bf41fdb255e4582f35134665a1#file-model-form-html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/58c2d6bf41fdb255e4582f35134665a1#file-model-form-html</a> Notice how much less code is needed. But, you may ask, how do I get the code in and out of the field?  How do I validate the field? Oh, but you see, that is exactly why I love Model Driven forms.  That’s all in the TypeScript code. But other than the fact that there is less code in the template and we can handle everything about the form in our TypeScript, the main difference between Template Driven Forms and Model Driven Forms is that Model Driven Forms let us treat the form as a whole rather than individual parts.  This solves problems that used to be rather tricky using Template Driven Forms.</p>
<h2 id="Flexible-Validation"><a href="#Flexible-Validation" class="headerlink" title="Flexible Validation"></a>Flexible Validation</h2><p>Just so we have a reference, this is what our TypeScript code would look like to wire up our TypeScript code to our template. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/58c2d6bf41fdb255e4582f35134665a1#file-model-form-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/58c2d6bf41fdb255e4582f35134665a1#file-model-form-ts</a> <code>this.form</code> references a public member in the form class.  It is the same name that we named our form group in the template file. Within the form group, we have a property for each field in our form group.  In the sample above, we only created one input field named ‘name’.  This form group references two other fields, ‘sex’ and ‘dob’.  I added these in so I could show you some other features. You’ll see that we’ve defined some validations.  Simply required validations until we get to ‘dob’ where we want to make sure we give them a real date.  For this, we use two new features.  We use the <code>compose</code> feature to combine several validations into one.  We also created a custom validation called <code>isDate.</code> Custom validations are static methods that take the control they are associated with as a parameter.  Each control has a value property that you can use to retrieve the current value of the control. The problem that this solves is that now we can write any validation we need without having to make it a directive.  We could also cross validate between this control and another control on the form by climbing up to the parent Form Group and back down to a sibling Form Control.  It really is quite flexible.</p>
<h2 id="Easy-Change-Detection"><a href="#Easy-Change-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Easy Change Detection"></a>Easy Change Detection</h2><p>If you are working with Template Driven Forms, you know that the way you know a value in a control has changed is because the property it is associated with gets a new value.  Setting up a simple setter lets you know the field has changed.  Or if you prefer you can use the split syntax of <code>[ngModel]=&#39;field&#39; (ngModelChange)=&#39;changeHander($event)&#39;</code> In Model Driven forms we can tell when any field has changed by subscribing to the valueChanges property. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/58c2d6bf41fdb255e4582f35134665a1#file-model-form-subscribe-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/58c2d6bf41fdb255e4582f35134665a1#file-model-form-subscribe-ts</a> The value that gets passed in has information about the field or fields that changed.  So, rather than getting every field every time, you are only getting the information that actually changed.  So, in your subscription, you can detect what changed and deal with that field individually if you need to.  In the code above, I’m just dispatching the new state to my reducer.  By doing this, my store has the current state so that when I’m ready to put it in a database, I don’t have to go around my form and gather up all the information.  I already have it all.</p>
<h2 id="Centralized-Form-Handling"><a href="#Centralized-Form-Handling" class="headerlink" title="Centralized Form Handling"></a>Centralized Form Handling</h2><p>And that’s what I mean by “Centralized Form Handling.”  All my form validation stuff is centralized.  All of the code I need to get the data out of my form is centralized.  And, as you’ll see soon, all of the code I need to get the data into my form is centralized.</p>
<h2 id="Completing-the-Picture"><a href="#Completing-the-Picture" class="headerlink" title="Completing the Picture"></a>Completing the Picture</h2><p>The only bit we have left out is, how do we get the data into the form? That’s pretty easy. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/58c2d6bf41fdb255e4582f35134665a1#file-model-form-patch-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/58c2d6bf41fdb255e4582f35134665a1#file-model-form-patch-ts</a> Where contract is an object that has the new data I want to put into the corresponding fields.</p>
<h2 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h2><p>One thing we haven’t talked about is my favorite subject of testing.  Because all of our logic resides in our TypeScript file, testing our screen logic becomes almost trivial.  In fact, if you’ve done this correctly, you shouldn’t need to write anything more than a set of Unit Tests to make sure your screen works as expected.  If you marry this with NgRX/Store, you will be even better off because you’ll never have to deal with a real database while testing your screen.  And you won’t have to do a lot of mocking to achieve this.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, maybe this hasn’t convinced you.  So, here is a challenge.  Try it! While I have had people reject this model when I explain it to them, those who have actually tried it have seen that it really is a superior model.  Which just goes to show that my dad was right, “It is amazing how much I don’t understand, when it doesn’t fit my plan.”  </p>

        <p>If you are using Angular(2+) and you are looking for an easy way to layout your components that gives you lots of flexibility and very few restrictions, you owe it to yourself to checkout <a href="//github.com/angular/flex-layout">Angular Flex Layout</a>.  While it is still in Beta, the framework is quite usable.  I’ve been using it in one of my projects and I’ve been quite happy with the results.

<h2 id="The-Old-Days"><a href="#The-Old-Days" class="headerlink" title="The Old Days"></a>The Old Days</h2><h3 id="Straight-CSS"><a href="#Straight-CSS" class="headerlink" title="Straight CSS"></a>Straight CSS</h3><p>I tell people, “I’ve been programming websites since ‘Al Gore invented the Internet’” Which is to say, some time prior to 1998.  So, I’ve had to deal with layout issues for a very long time.  At least in terms of “Internet Time.”  And during that time, being able to lay things out on the page in some sort of intelligent way has matured quite a bit.  But still, coding it all by hand, unless you are a fulltime CSS person, is not the best use of my time. This is, in part, why Bootstrap was created.</p>
<h3 id="Bootstrap"><a href="#Bootstrap" class="headerlink" title="Bootstrap"></a>Bootstrap</h3><p>I generally love Bootstrap.  A great CSS framework that allows me to style my application easily, is easy to modify, and has a pretty respectable grid systems for placing my controls on the page.  The problem with Bootstrap though is that the grid system is really all you have available for layout, and it is rather limited.  At least that has been my experience.  By default, you get a grid with 12 columns.  And while you can next grids in other grids, you still end up with alignment issues.  There must be an easier way.</p>
<h3 id="AngularJS-Material-Design"><a href="#AngularJS-Material-Design" class="headerlink" title="AngularJS Material Design"></a>AngularJS Material Design</h3><p>The Angular Flex Layout used to be part of the AngularJS Material Design project.  But instead of making it part of the Angular Material Design project, it has been broken out so that we can use it in combination with other systems.  Grids where they make sense and Flex Layout where that will work better.</p>
<h2 id="Flex-Layout-Benefits"><a href="#Flex-Layout-Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Flex Layout Benefits"></a>Flex Layout Benefits</h2><h3 id="No-Grids"><a href="#No-Grids" class="headerlink" title="No Grids"></a>No Grids</h3><p>Now, what makes Flex Layout so great?  The first thing that I think of is that I can do everything I was able to do with the Bootstrap grid system, but I have a lot more control.  In fact, this past week, I converted an existing layout that was using nested grids to achieve the layout I was looking for and flattened it significantly by switching it to use Flex.  You see, in Flex, you can say you want a row and then for each cell in that row, you can specify the width of the cell in any unit you want, or you can tell it to take up the remaining space.  And just like Bootstrap grids, the DIVs wrap if needed.</p>
<h3 id="Directive-Based"><a href="#Directive-Based" class="headerlink" title="Directive Based"></a>Directive Based</h3><p>The other thing that is true of flex is that all of this control is specified at the template level.  I’m not specifying layout in a file that is separate from the template I want to apply it to. Now, the CSS purist might object to this.  “Style information should all go in a global CSS file so you aren’t repeating yourself.”  They’ll say.  Well, yes, that’s true, if you are creating multiple pages that you want to all look the same.  But we are talking about Angular here.  A Single Page Application.  If you have multiple templates that all need the same layout information, you are probably not thinking about your components correctly.  That is, your problem isn’t a CSS/Style issue, it is a component issue. In a SPA, each page looks the same because each page uses the same parent component.  Rarely, do you really have a need to share layout styles.  Mostly we share component look and feel.  That’s different.</p>
<h3 id="Responsive"><a href="#Responsive" class="headerlink" title="Responsive"></a>Responsive</h3><p>And if I want a cell to be one size for desktop and another size for tablets or phones, I can easily specify what size each should be.  Similar to how we would do it with Bootstrap, but in much finer detail.</p>
<h2 id="It’s-Just-CSS"><a href="#It’s-Just-CSS" class="headerlink" title="It’s Just CSS"></a>It’s Just CSS</h2><p>Before we move on, I want to point out that Flex Layout doesn’t do anything that the current CSS spec doesn’t already allow us to do.  However, the current Flexbox CSS implementations are so new that each browser implements the spec enough different that we can’t be sure the styles will work the same way as we move from browser to browser. What Flex Layout attempts to do is to normalize the differences in a way similar to how jQuery normalized the DOM for us.  Someday, we may not need Flex Layout.  But until then, this is going to save you a lot of time trying to figure things out.</p>
<h2 id="What-You-Can-Do"><a href="#What-You-Can-Do" class="headerlink" title="What You Can Do"></a>What You Can Do</h2><h3 id="Maintain-Aspect-Ratios"><a href="#Maintain-Aspect-Ratios" class="headerlink" title="Maintain Aspect Ratios"></a>Maintain Aspect Ratios</h3><p>I first started playing with the Flexbox CSS spec when I needed to implement a layout that included a video player that was bounded by a splitter control.  As the splitter resizes the panel, the video needs to shrink and grow maintaining the aspect ratio while at the same time allowing the cell under it to grow and shrink.  This is something that Flex can handle easily.</p>
<h3 id="Rows-with-Cells"><a href="#Rows-with-Cells" class="headerlink" title="Rows with Cells"></a>Rows with Cells</h3><p>As I’ve already mentioned, it is as easy to setup a new row and place wrapping DIVs in it as it is with Bootstrap.</p>
<h3 id="Columns-with-Cells"><a href="#Columns-with-Cells" class="headerlink" title="Columns with Cells"></a>Columns with Cells</h3><p>But unlike Bootstrap, you can also create groups of Columns with Cells.</p>
<h3 id="Responsive-Card-Layouts"><a href="#Responsive-Card-Layouts" class="headerlink" title="Responsive Card Layouts"></a>Responsive Card Layouts</h3><p>The last couple of weeks, I needed to implement a card layout that changed the number of columns displayed based on the width of the container.  By using Flex Layout along with min-width and max-width on the cards, I was able to get this to layout correctly regardless of the container width.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>I’m not going to spend a lot of time going over the ins and outs of using Flex Layout.  They do a pretty respectable job on the website.  But, the one thing I did have trouble getting started with was exactly what syntax to use.  Some of the stuff I found used <code>fx-flex</code> syntax and other sites used <code>fxFlex</code>.  The one you want is <code>fxFlex</code>.  That and a bit of experimentation should get you well on your way.</p>

        <p>Unit Testing Angular(2+) with JSDOM can be problematic unless you know the secret handshake that allows ZoneJS and JSDOM to coexist. The great thing about Angular is that you can write Unit Tests from the presentation layer all the way down to calls to the server.  But up until now, you either ran those tests in a browser, which doesn’t work well in a CI system, or you used PhantomJS, which tends to be REALLY slow!  But there is a better way, and hopefully, by the time this post goes live, the patches needed to use JSDOM will be available.  If not, I’ll show you the hack that I’ve found works and the pull request I’m hoping will go live. [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/image.png" alt="Unit Testing Angular(2+) with JSDOM" title="Unit Testing Angular(2+) with JSDOM"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/juanedc/14896919066/">Juanedc</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/cf947c">Visual Hunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"> CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Why-JSDOM"><a href="#Why-JSDOM" class="headerlink" title="Why JSDOM?"></a>Why JSDOM?</h2><p>As I mentioned in the introduction, there are two problems that JSDOM fixes. To run the Angular unit tests, you need to run them in a browser.  The problem with this is that you would need to have a browser installed on your CI server to run them, if you run them at all.  It can be done, but if you are working in an environment like the one I work in, it isn’t going to be easy. The second choice is to use PhantomJS.  Unfortunately, PhantomJS, while easy to install, runs slowly.  For all but the most trivial of applications, this isn’t going to work well. JSDOM, on the other hand, runs fast like a browser, and doesn’t have the problems that running it on a CI system has.  This is because it is a headless browser that never renders.  All it does is produce HTML.  For unit tests, this is all we really care about.  And because it is running inside of Node, it is running as fast as the V8 engine will let it.  Making it theoretically faster than running the tests in Chrome.  I say, “theoretically faster” because I have not tested this and the V8 engines in the most recent browser tends to be a bit ahead of the V8 engine used in the most recent version of Node.</p>
<h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>Knowing this was possible caused me to give it a try.  What I found was that I routinely crashed with the following error. <code>Cannot set property onreadystatechange of [object Object] which has only a getter</code> As I googled this, I found several fixes for JSDOM that would allow this to work, but I also discovered that JSDOM did not consider this an issue they needed to fix.  And rightly so, why should they adapt just so it would work for Angular2? But, what in the Angular2 code would cause this problem.  By doing a search for <code>onreadystatechange</code> in my node_modules directory, I discovered that ZoneJS was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saving off the original definition of <code>onreadystatechange</code></li>
<li>Overriding the definition with a getter (only)</li>
<li>Setting the definition back to the original</li>
</ol>
<p>Which all works well if the original <code>onreadystatechange</code> has a definition.  But in the case of JSDOM, it doesn’t.  Then, when they set the definition back, nothing happens and we keep the definition they created.</p>
<h2 id="Solution-1"><a href="#Solution-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1"></a>Solution 1</h2><p>The file in question is <code>property-descriptor.ts</code> under the <code>lib/browser</code> directory (the js version is in the file <code>zone.js</code> under the <code>dist</code> directory).  Sticking with the TS file… of version 0.8.5, scroll down to line 64 and you’ll see that they retrieve the current definition but never verify that they actually got something back.  But at line 80 they set it back to an empty object if it doesn’t exist. The easy fix that seems to work for me, is to just change the new definition so that it works if that is the one that is left over after this function completes: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/dbaa474a79924f9450644de80d76c875#file-fix-one-a-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/dbaa474a79924f9450644de80d76c875#file-fix-one-a-ts</a> Because we’ve changed the getter from returning a hardcoded value, we also need to set <code>onreadystatechange</code> <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/dbaa474a79924f9450644de80d76c875#file-fix-one-b-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/dbaa474a79924f9450644de80d76c875#file-fix-one-b-ts</a> The full fix looks like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/dbaa474a79924f9450644de80d76c875#file-fix-one-full-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/dbaa474a79924f9450644de80d76c875#file-fix-one-full-ts</a></p>
<h2 id="Solution-2"><a href="#Solution-2" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2"></a>Solution 2</h2><p>The <a href="//github.com/angular/zone.js/pull/711/commits/edc9d7a2145f9ddc4acbe6a49d1325d676c65429">current pull request</a> adds a bit more code that I’m assuming is needed.  I haven’t tested this, but I’m assuming it is a safer alternative than my hack.</p>
<h2 id="One-Additional-Gotcha"><a href="#One-Additional-Gotcha" class="headerlink" title="One Additional Gotcha!"></a>One Additional Gotcha!</h2><p>Once I had this basic issue solved, I was able to run my suite of test with the exception of one.  It turns out <code>element.innerText</code> doesn’t exist in JSDOM.  There is a technical reason for this that I won’t discuss here other than to say it is, evidently, somehow dependant on the rendering engine, and since JSDOM has no rendering engine (remember, it just produces HTML) it can’t really implement <code>innerText</code>.  So, I had to refactor my test to use <code>innerHTML</code> instead.  Trivial issue.  Just something you need to be aware of.</p>
<h2 id="Setting-Up-Karma"><a href="#Setting-Up-Karma" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up Karma"></a>Setting Up Karma</h2><p>Now, from here to the end, we are going to assume that this got fixed, or you are using one of the solutions above.  Now, how do we set karma up to use JSDOM instead of Chrome or PhantomJS? Well, for starters, you’ll need to <code>npm install --save-dev jsdom karma-jsdom-launcher</code>. Then, you’ll need to make a few changes to your <code>karma.conf.js</code> file. First, in the plugins array, add <code>require(&#39;karma-jsdom-launcher&#39;)</code>. Then, at the bottom of the file, change the browsers line to specify <code>&#39;jsdom&#39;</code> instead of <code>&#39;Chrome&#39;</code>. I normally just comment out the Chrome line and put in a line for jsdom so I can use Chrome to debug when I need to. I’ve always said that Angular mixes the best of AngularJS and React and with this fix, we now have some of the React Unit Testing goodness added into the mix.</p>
