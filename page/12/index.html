        <p>In my recent discussions with hiring managers about how hard it is to find good developers, the realization has slowly dawned on me that the programming language to learn today is JavaScript.  This is particularly true if you are a web developer, but I would be inclined to just make a blanket statement.  If you are a programmer, you should learn JavaScript.</p>

        <p>I’ve been using the CefSharp.Offscreen library to drive the Chromium browser for a couple of months now.  While the code I’ve been working on has been working correctly, I could never figure out why so many instances of Chromium are left dangling in my task manager.  Oh, they’d all go away once I exited the application, but then it would take a very long time for my application to completely close because there were so many instances of Chromium hanging around.</p>
<p>This past week, I finally figured out how to keep the number of Chromium instances in line with the number of off-screen browser windows I was actually creating.</p>

  <div class="article-inner">

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’ve been looking at Angular.js recently.  I’ve already got enough of a project done in <a href="//www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> (with <a href="//mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a>), <a href="//expressjs.com/">Express</a>, <a href="//angularjs.org/">Angular</a> and <a href="//nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> (MEAN) to be comfortable with how Angular works.  But I wanted to give it a try using ASP.NET as the back end.  I’m always learning.  Always improving. To start out, I just setup an index.html page to hold my basic form as I got the basic look and feel going.  But as I progressed, I wanted to make sure I progressed, I wanted to add in the capability of using Angular’s html5mode for the client side routing. For those of you who are new to Angular, Angular is a client side JavaScript framework that will allow you to create web applications where much of the processing happens on the client side instead of the server side.  That’s cool enough.  But it also adds the ability to handle client side routing, just like ASP.NET’s MVC handles server side routing.  This allows you to have a client side “master page” that can suck in the differences from the server as it needs them based on the url that is in the address bar.  In fact, there is an extension that will let you have sub routes as far down as you need. Out of the box, Angular, and most other frameworks that implement client side routing, using the hash symbol to specify the route.  For example</p>
<p>http:/index.html#/pathToRoute</p>
<p>This allows the routing to work on older browsers. ASP.NET, Angular.js &amp; html5mode <img src="/uploads/2015/09/image3.png" alt="image" title="image"> ASP.NET, Angular.js &amp; html5modeBut if you are working with newer browsers that support HTML5, you can avoid the hash tag and just create a route that looks like this:</p>
<p>http:/pathToRoute</p>
<p>Which you have to admit, looks a whole lot nicer. But here  is where the problems start. As soon as you implement html5mode on a site that is hosted in IIS or IIS express, you will get a 404 error because your initial request to the server is going to ask the server for a path that doesn’t exist. There are a few ways that you can take care of this.</p>
<h2 id="Return-a-default-view-for-every-undefined-server-route"><a href="#Return-a-default-view-for-every-undefined-server-route" class="headerlink" title="Return a default view for every undefined server route."></a>Return a default view for every undefined server route.</h2><p>One of the first suggestions you are likely to find suggest creating a default view for all routes that start with “/angular/”. This is a great start.  But here are my issues with it.  If I really want to use Angular the way it was intended to be used, I would prefer to not have to use MVC on the server side at all.  While not a huge hit, writing a razor page just to get my initial angular page up seems to be a bit of overkill.  There must be a way to do this without creating a *.chshtml file.  I also don’t want to have a sub directory for my page.  Why can’t I just go to <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com">http://blog.dmbcllc.com</a> as my default route?  And why can’t I just return a plain old html file?! Well, it turns out you can.  A slight modification of the “Return a default view” method is to have your controller return your html page.</p>
<h2 id="Return-an-HTML-page-direct-from-the-controller"><a href="#Return-an-HTML-page-direct-from-the-controller" class="headerlink" title="Return an HTML page direct from the controller."></a>Return an HTML page direct from the controller.</h2><p>If you dig a bit further, you’ll find that someone else has realized that you can just return your HTML directly from the controller.  The magic to this trick is all similar to what the guy in the original article did except for in the controller, instead of returning the view, he returns the html file that contains the main html.</p>
<p>public ActionResult Index()<br>{<br>    return File(“~/yourstartpage.html”, “text/html”);<br>}</p>
<p>And his main MVC route looks like this:</p>
<p>routes.MapRoute(<br>      name: “Default”,<br>      url: “{*.}”,<br>      defaults: new<br>      {<br>        controller = “Home”,<br>        action = “Index”,<br>      }<br>  );</p>
<p>This implementation has the added benefit that I’m not tied to a specific sub directory because it just says, “Any URL that doesn’t have a real file behind it should resolve to this default route.” Of course, you may be thinking, but what about the WEB API route, or any other routes I want in my system.  Well, just make sure this route comes first and you have other routes to cover the real routes you want to be able to support. Now, this gets past the objection I had with the first solution.  I no longer have to have a route.  But, why should I need to call the controller?  This is just a static HTML file we are talking about.  I should be able to by pass ASP.NET handling this file and just have IIS serve it up directly to me.</p>
<h2 id="Use-the-URL-Rewrite-Module"><a href="#Use-the-URL-Rewrite-Module" class="headerlink" title="Use the URL Rewrite Module"></a>Use the URL Rewrite Module</h2><p>A little deeper digging on the search engines reminded me that  I could just setup the <a href="//www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite">URL Rewrite module</a> to return my main HTML page when no real page is available.  BTW, URL Rewrite is built into IIS Express, so it should work in your development environment if you are using IIS Express as well as under IIS with the module installed. The main step to getting this working is to add the following XML to your Web.config file:</p>
<p>&lt;system.webServer&gt;<br>    <rewrite><br>        <rules><br>            <rule name="angularjs routes" stopprocessing="true"><br>                <match url=".*"><br>                <conditions logicalgrouping="MatchAll"><br>                    <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchtype="IsFile" negate="true"><br>                    <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchtype="IsDirectory" negate="true"><br>                    <add input="{REQUEST_URI}" pattern="^/(api)" negate="true"><br>                </add></add></add></conditions><br>                <action type="Rewrite" url="/"><br>            </action></match></rule><br>        </rules><br>    </rewrite><br>&lt;/system.webServer&gt;</p>
<p>You should already have a system.webServer section in your web.config file, so you just need the rewrite rule inside of it. Basically what this rule does is that it says, “If you can’t find the file, and the path you are looking for is not a subdirectory of the “api” directory, return the default file at the root.”  The part about the API directory allows your WEB API stuff to continue working. The only other thing you will need to do, which isn’t unique to ASP.NET or MVC, is that you will need to remember to add the base tag to the HEAD section of your HTML file.</p>
<base href="/">

<p>And all of your client side routing with HTML5 issues should be solved. Notice that no ASP.NET code has to run to get this working.  In fact, the only time you’ll need to run ASP.NET is to call the server for data.</p>

        <p>Recently someone asked me where the business rules should go in an MVC framework.  The Model or the Controller? This reminded me of a post I wrote when ASP.NET MVC was first released.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/aspnet-mvc-model-bll-or-dal/">ASP.NET MVC – Model != BLL or DAL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But today I want to cover a broader topic common to everyone, not just programmers.  Not being able to think outside the box. <img src="/uploads/2015/09/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Here’s-the-deal"><a href="#Here’s-the-deal" class="headerlink" title="Here’s the deal."></a>Here’s the deal.</h2><p>Good salesmen have known for years that the best way to close the sale is to ask the customer to pick between two buying decisions.  You never ask, “So, did you want to buy that today?”  Because almost invariably the customer will say, “No” because the implication is, “Did you want to buy that today, or some other day?”  And “some other day” is always a better option to the customer.  No, the proper way to frame the question is, “So, how did you want to pay for that?  Cash or Credit?” or “Did you want the blue one or the green one?”  By doing this, the customer is no longer even thinking “later” is an option.  The only options he is thinking about are the options he’s been presented with.  This isn’t to say that there isn’t a customer who can fight past this and respond, “No, I was just looking today.”  But the chance of the customer leaving without buying have just been reduced dramatically because two buying choices have been presented. So, what does this have to do with programming?  Well, that’s exactly what happens when we’ve been given an architectural framework to program with. Someone shows you the MVC pattern and you immediately think that the only places code can live in our application are in the Model, the View, or the Controller. Someone shows you the MVP pattern and you think code can only live in the Model, the View or the Presenter. Someone shows you the MVVM pattern and we think code only lives in the Model, the View or the ViewModel. And so, I ask you. Given any of those three patterns, where do you put your business logic?  And while we are at it, where does your data access logic go?</p>
<h2 id="Do-we-place-it-in-the-model"><a href="#Do-we-place-it-in-the-model" class="headerlink" title="Do we place it in the model?"></a>Do we place it in the model?</h2><p>Well, what is the model for?  A model is for storing data.  For most of us the data is a record that is displayed on the screen as a series of fields.  But how it gets displayed and what it actually contains doesn’t matter as much as the fact that the model <strong>stores data</strong>.  Nothing there even hints at executing code.  In fact, I would argue that for most of our applications, the model should be so simple that it doesn’t need to be tested.</p>
<h2 id="How-about-the-Controller-or-the-Presenter"><a href="#How-about-the-Controller-or-the-Presenter" class="headerlink" title="How about the Controller or the Presenter?"></a>How about the Controller or the Presenter?</h2><p>A controller or presenter sends commands to the model to change its state and sends commands to the view to update the presentation.  Here things get a little confusing.  It sounds like, because the controller is sending commands the the model and the view that it is where the business rules live. In fact, when I was first introduced to MVC, this is what I thought was true.  But notice there is nothing in the statement about what a controller does that would indicate that it is anything more than a traffic cop.</p>
<h2 id="View-Model"><a href="#View-Model" class="headerlink" title="View Model?"></a>View Model?</h2><p>In the MVVM pattern, it becomes even clearer that there is no clear place for business logic because the ViewModel holds the state of the view.  The presenter or controller part is handled by a binder that is typically part of the framework you are using, as with KnockOut.</p>
<h2 id="Thinking-outside-the-box"><a href="#Thinking-outside-the-box" class="headerlink" title="Thinking outside the box"></a>Thinking outside the box</h2><p>Now that we’ve demonstrated that none of these frameworks explicitly state where the business logic should go, where should we put it? In my case, what I’ve started doing is that I’ve created a service layer, or a business rules layer.  It handles the processing of the logic to get the rest of the code working.  The classes in this layer can either be passed the model or viewmodel in which they can change the state directly, or they can return data that the controller can distribute as needed.  In my most recent application I selected the pass the model in approach.  The result was code that was much more testable than what I had started with, which is the whole point of placing the business rules outside of the pattern to begin with.  </p>

Someone will write a post about some technical interview question and someone will write a comment about how that’s such a dumb question that they wouldn’t even bother answering it.  I’ve actually been that guy recently.  John Sonmez wrote about “<a href="//simpleprogrammer.com/2015/01/19/cracking-the-coding-interview/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>” and I responded that I don’t do coding interviews.  <a href="/cracking-the-programmers-interview-code/">In fact, I wrote a whole post about this</a>.  But as John pointed out, this may actually cause you to be limiting your career.  You wouldn’t answer that question for a 33% raise?  Really?  There isn’t anything that could motivate you to consider answering a question that you feel is useless, stupid or dumb? This week, I saw another post about some technical interview question that someone said he wouldn’t answer.  Sorry, I don’t have a link for that one, I wish I did. And then add to this, the number of useless interview questions I have answered in the last year.  Why did I answer them?  Because I could.  Because the challenge was actually fun. And so, let’s reconsider the arrogant stance of “Thanks for your time, I’ll show myself out.” First let’s consider why we might not want to answer a particular question. <img src="/uploads/2015/09/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Telling-The-Truth-Makes-You-Happier"><a href="#Telling-The-Truth-Makes-You-Happier" class="headerlink" title="Telling The Truth Makes You Happier."></a>Telling The Truth Makes You Happier.</h2><p>As I said, I’ve answered a lot of useless questions.  Most recently, I was asked about how garbage collection works in .NET.  When is the last time anyone needed to know that?  Isn’t the whole point of .NET that memory management gets handled for you?  Someone else may have refused to answer the question.  Why?  Because we don’t think we can. The reason I don’t like code interviews is because 1) I’ve never had to do one and 2) I’m afraid I won’t be able to do it. Dumb reason! The post I mentioned earlier that I don’t have a link for was something about how linked lists worked.  Or sorting.  Why did he consider it an issue?  Maybe because he didn’t feel like he could answer it? Let’s face it, most of use, rather than admitting we don’t know something, would just rather deflect the problem to the person asking the question. And so, the first way that just answering the question will make you happier is that telling the truth makes you happier. The more honest we are with ourselves and with others, <a href="//www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life/time-to-come-clean-little-white-lies-found-to-be-a-health-hazard-20120805-23o0t.html">the happier we are</a>. So, rather than taking the stance of “I won’t answer that question”, why not prepare yourself so that you CAN answer the question? And this leads to my second reason…</p>
<h2 id="You-Will-Gain-Confidence"><a href="#You-Will-Gain-Confidence" class="headerlink" title="You Will Gain Confidence"></a>You Will Gain Confidence</h2><p>How’s that?  Well, let’s say you answer the question, the first time, the best way that you know how but you know you were pretty shaky.  So, you go home, and look up the answer.  The next time you get asked the question, you are better prepared.  You’ve learned something along the way and are now more confident.  Or, you may find out that the question wasn’t all that important given all you were able to answer. I’ll tell you a little insider secret.  If you really know your stuff, you’ll probably get the job anyhow.  The interviewer is just trying to figure out how much you know.  If you’ve gotten to the point where they are asking one of these seemingly irrelevant questions, you’ve probably already got the job. Most people can’t even answer the basic questions I’ve previously blogged about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/7-c-interview-questions-that-weed-out-the-losers/">Basic C# Questions</a></li>
<li><a href="/7-javascript-interview-questions-to-weed-out-imposters/">Basic JavaScript Questions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I know of at least two places that have interviewed 10 people just to find one that would be OK.  Knowing this, alone, has given me a lot more confidence when I interview. But as people have mentioned on those post, just because they can answer the questions, doesn’t mean they can code.  We have to have other questions we can ask you to get at that. I’ve been in two interviews, that I can remember that did this well.  One was for a position that was mostly JavaScript.  In fact, he never asked me anything about C#.  What he said was something like, “I know nothing about JavaScript, tell me about JavaScript.”  And then he stopped talking and listened to me.  Every once in a while he would say, “Tell me more about that.”  That was the entire interview. A couple of weeks ago, I was asked to talk about my experience with ASP.NET’s MVC. A question that was just as open ended.  The guy’s boss, who was the hiring manager, questioned the open endedness of the question.  The response was, “I want to know if he’s worked with it before.  If he has, he should be able to answer that question.” Interestingly, there were no JavaScript questions this time.</p>
<h2 id="You-Might-Get-Your-Dream-Job"><a href="#You-Might-Get-Your-Dream-Job" class="headerlink" title="You Might Get Your Dream Job"></a>You Might Get Your Dream Job</h2><p>Listen!  You decided to interview, I assume, because you wanted this job, or at least thought you might want this job.  You’re going to walk out of an interview and make yourself look like an ass simply because you don’t like the question?  Who is being dumb now?! Like I said, it is so hard to find good talent, that if they are asking hard questions, you’ve probably already got the job anyhow.  But if you walk out, not only do you not have the job, but you’ll never get a second chance to interview with the people in the room again, and that includes when they show up at other companies.  Think that’s not true?  I know I keep a mental list of people I might want to consider in the future.  Both people I’ve worked with and people I’ve interviewed. So take your best stab at the question.  There have been a number of times when my answer has been, I don’t know, but here is how I’d find out when I needed it.  Often the “how I’d get the information answer” is better than actually being able to answer the question. So, dare to answer the questions.  The results might surprise you.    </p>

        <p>I just got back from sending my last child off to college.  OK.  Now that you all have some vague idea of how old I am…</p>
<p>The weekend had all kinds of events that would make for good blog post.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality Matters – and is relatively cheap.</li>
<li>Advice to Freshman – and young professionals.</li>
<li>Be consistent with yourself – and learn to say no.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I think I can hit the other two by focusing on the second, we are going to go after ‘Advice to Freshman’.</p>
<p>The advice I am going to provide here is going to be both general in nature and specific to the IT crowd.  It is what I would tell a young IT person if I were coaching or giving a speech.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2015/09/image.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Get-a-Job-–-Any-Job"><a href="#Get-a-Job-–-Any-Job" class="headerlink" title="Get a Job – Any Job"></a>Get a Job – Any Job</h2><p>I don’t care if your family is independently wealthy or not.  Get a job.  Any job.  The research has shown that kids that have jobs do better in college than those who don’t.  The ‘Any Job’ part if aimed at those of you who are WAY too picky about what you will or will not do.  Moral qualms aside, you should be glad to be able to do just about anything.  Wash dishes, take out trash, mow the lawn, or work in sales (yes, even if you aren’t a people person).  The fact of the matter is, you need a job to get a job.  So unless you’ve already had a job, you just need something.  Once you have that job, you can start looking for the next job in about four months.  Bootstrap yourself into the job you want.  Start out with the job you can get.</p>
<h2 id="Establish-Relationships"><a href="#Establish-Relationships" class="headerlink" title="Establish Relationships"></a>Establish Relationships</h2><p>I know, this is going to be hard for some of you.  It was hard for me.  But relationships are what is going to get you jobs in the future.  Your degree will only help you get your first job.  From there on out it will be who knows you, what you are known for, and what you’ve done.  Take the long view and build relationships that will last past college.</p>
<h2 id="Be-Picky"><a href="#Be-Picky" class="headerlink" title="Be Picky"></a>Be Picky</h2><p>While you need to build relationships, you need to be careful who you build those relationships with.  Who do you want to be like?  You are the average of the 5 people you hang with the most.  So while you need to establish relationships, you need to be careful who you build those relationships with.</p>
<h2 id="Get-On-LinkedIn"><a href="#Get-On-LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="Get On LinkedIn"></a>Get On LinkedIn</h2><p>I’ve written about <a href="/linkedin-tips-for-programmers/">how to use LinkedIn</a> before.  LinkedIn is the key part of my “be everywhere” strategy.  The more people you know in your industry and your location, the easier it will be to find a job.  My experience has been that the more people I am connected to on LinkedIn, the more likely I am to have the work find me.</p>
<h2 id="Be-Consistent-with-Yourself"><a href="#Be-Consistent-with-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Be Consistent with Yourself"></a>Be Consistent with Yourself</h2><p>By this I mean, don’t go wild just because you can.  When you graduate and you want to find a job.  Who do you want to be known as?  Don’t be afraid to stand out.  In fact, the more you stand out (in good ways) the better your future will be.  No one should have to ask, ‘Why should I hire you over anyone else your age?’</p>
<h2 id="Quality-Matters"><a href="#Quality-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Quality Matters"></a>Quality Matters</h2><p>We went into a couple “Nice” restaurants this past weekend.  It was interesting that the one where I paid 20% – 30% more was probably twice as nice.  Quality doesn’t have to cost a whole lot.</p>
<p>If you have an assignment that is due, make it easy for your instructor to read.  Pretend you are going to publish your work for the world to read and that they are going to pay a lot of money for it.  Trust me, this will be reflected in your grade.</p>
<h2 id="Learn-How-to-Use-Version-Control"><a href="#Learn-How-to-Use-Version-Control" class="headerlink" title="Learn How to Use Version Control"></a>Learn How to Use Version Control</h2><p>I heard this morning that schools aren’t teaching students how to use version control.  If you are working on a group project, get a version control system and learn how to use it.  You’ll thank me later.</p>
<p>If you are working on your own project, use version control.  The easiest way to get setup is to sign up for Visual Studio Online (which is a total misnomer).  Visual Studio Online is really TFS online.  Set it up to use GIT for the backing storage instead of TFVS.</p>
<p>Here is how this is going to help you.  At some point, you will be working on a project and you’ll realize that you’ve made a mistake and you need to get back to where you were two hours ago.  The problem is, to get back to where you were manually, it will take you at least two hours.  More likely it will take you four hours.  With version control, you can revert to where you were (assuming that you’ve been committing all alone the way).</p>
<h2 id="Learn-How-to-Learn"><a href="#Learn-How-to-Learn" class="headerlink" title="Learn How to Learn"></a>Learn How to Learn</h2><p>I’m sorry, most of what you are going to learn in the next four years will be worthless by the time you graduate if it isn’t already.  But colleges have to teach something.  Many are at least teaching Java or C#, which is a good start.  But assuming those languages are still what companies want four years from now, they will look significantly different from what they do today.</p>
<p>So, while it may be helpful to understand the syntax, and to be able to explain polymorphism, or to write some cool code.  What is really going to help you in the long term is the ability to pick up new stuff as it comes out.</p>
<h2 id="Start-a-Blog"><a href="#Start-a-Blog" class="headerlink" title="Start a Blog"></a>Start a Blog</h2><p>Nothing teaches like teaching.  Start a blog and share what you are learning with the world.  It will help you crystalize your thinking as you go.</p>
<h2 id="Never-Pull-an-All-Nighter"><a href="#Never-Pull-an-All-Nighter" class="headerlink" title="Never Pull an All-Nighter"></a>Never Pull an All-Nighter</h2><p>Yeah, I know it is cool to say you pulled an all-nighter.  But if you don’t know the material by the night before the test, you aren’t going to learn it any better in the time you should be sleeping.  In fact, staying up to learn material you should already know may actually make it less likely that you will remember the material the next day than if you had slept.</p>
<p>Good luck as you navigate your way through life.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/08/image3.png" alt="image" title="image"> A couple of weeks ago I wrote a post “<a href="/7-c-interview-questions-that-weed-out-the-losers/">7 C# Interview Questions to Weed out Losers</a>” which was my most popular post yet.  As of this writing, it has received over 13,000 views.  It also got a lot of comments. While there are a lot of things I could respond to, the one I want to focus on today is what I would call, “The fallacy of concepts over terminology.” While none of the comments actually come out and say this, several imply that knowing the concept but not knowing the proper term for it is enough.  In conversations with people I’ve worked with, I’ve received similar feedback.  In fact, as recent as three years ago I actually told someone, “If you want someone who can pass some sort of test, I’m probably not your guy.  If you want someone who is an awesome programmer, I’m your guy.” But three more years of experience has changed my mind.</p>
<h2 id="Knowing-the-Proper-Terms-Clarifies-Communication"><a href="#Knowing-the-Proper-Terms-Clarifies-Communication" class="headerlink" title=" Knowing the Proper Terms Clarifies Communication"></a> Knowing the Proper Terms Clarifies Communication</h2><blockquote>
<p>“’When <strong>I</strong> use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.’” – Through the Looking Glass, by Lewis Carroll</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are just a few examples of how knowing what a term actually means helps communication: As I’ve written before, I’ve been using Sencha’s EXTjs at my day job.  When I first started using this environment, the first thing I was told was that it uses the “MVC Architecture.”  Now, to me, MVC has a very specific meaning and more importantly implies certain qualities about how the code should be written.  Primary among them is that the Model, View, and Controller are loosely coupled.  Anyone who has used EXTjs 4 knows this is not necessarily true.  What they call the “Controller” is more accurately called a “ViewController” but even then, it isn’t really.  You can’t have a controller without having a view, which makes the whole thing quite hard to test.  This whole mislabeling thing set me back about two weeks in my attempt to learn the framework. Another example from my work place.  We’ve created our own ORM to access the DB2 database we have to work with.  Why?  Because DB2 doesn’t play nice with Entity Framework.  But here again, I was told that this code implemented a design pattern that it doesn’t really implement.  Since the number of times I have to interact with this code is trivial, it was not as costly to my learning.  But it did cause confusion. Probably the most notable misuse of a word in our industry is the word “Agile.”  As I’ve been interviewing, I’ve run into a lot of companies who call themselves “Agile” but I’ve found that what they mean by “Agile” is very different from how the Agile Manifesto defines Agile.  In fact, one of the questions I ask during the interview to companies who have promoted themselves as “Agile” is, “How do you define Agile?”  One of the first places I asked this question replied, “Oh that just means we program iteratively.” So, knowing the proper term for a concept, makes your communication clear.  But that doesn’t explain why I expect someone I’m interviewing to know the term I’m using.</p>
<h2 id="Knowing-the-Proper-Term-Shortens-Communication"><a href="#Knowing-the-Proper-Term-Shortens-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Knowing the Proper Term Shortens Communication"></a>Knowing the Proper Term Shortens Communication</h2><p>Way back when I was first learning object oriented programming with C++, someone asked me what polymorphism was.  I couldn’t answer because I’d never heard of the word or hadn’t taken the time to find out what it means.  I can’t remember exactly.  But I had the same reaction many of you did.  “I know what virtual functions are and I know how to give a function multiple implementations by changing the signature, I just don’t know the word for it.” But you see, it is much easier to ask, “What is polymorphism?”  Than it is to ask, “What do the keywords ‘overridable’, and ‘overrides’ do?”  And then have to follow up with “what does the ‘new’ keyword do when placed in front of a method declaration?” Spoken languages have terms for the various parts of speech.  If you are a programmer, I’m sure you know about this, even if you can’t name them.  But, let’s say you were a professional writer or an editor.  You probably wouldn’t be able to even get a job if you couldn’t talk about the various parts of speech using the proper terms.  And yet, many of us expect that we should be allowed to write code without having the same ability. Which leads to my next reason.</p>
<h2 id="Knowing-the-Proper-Term-Aids-in-Learning"><a href="#Knowing-the-Proper-Term-Aids-in-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Knowing the Proper Term Aids in Learning"></a>Knowing the Proper Term Aids in Learning</h2><p>My family is a languages family.  My wife knows English, French, Latin (from teaching the kids), and Biblical Greek.  My daughter was an English major and learned Latin during High School.  My oldest son, knows English, Latin, Greek, and a bit of German.  My youngest son knows English, Latin, a bit of Greek and German.  I barely know English well enough to get these post written every week.  Which gives me a unique perspective. What I’ve learned as I’ve watched my family play with languages is that because they know the parts of speech in the various languages, as they pick up a new language, they can talk about a word being in a particular tense, or case, or whatever and everyone knows exactly what they are saying, making it that much easier to pick up a new language. In fact, while my son was learning German in High School, he would come home and talk to his mom and sister in German and they would be able to make out most of what he was saying because they had enough back ground in other languages and when they didn’t know something they could talk about it using the terms for the various parts of speech. This was true for me as I moved from C++ to Java and then to C# and VB.NET.  Because I already knew what polymorphism was, all I needed to know was the mechanisms in the other languages that made that feature happen.</p>
<h2 id="If-You-Know-the-Terminology-You-Probably-Know-the-Concept"><a href="#If-You-Know-the-Terminology-You-Probably-Know-the-Concept" class="headerlink" title="If You Know the Terminology, You Probably Know the Concept"></a>If You Know the Terminology, You Probably Know the Concept</h2><p>One of the complaints I got specifically accused me of asking questions that only proved that the applicant could pass a test.  And this is true.  If all I were to ask were these questions, this would be a bad interview indeed.  But here’s what I’ve found.  Most of the time, if you can answer the questions I’ve asked in that article, you are much more likely to be able to answer the questions I really care about.  “Are you a hack, or do you really know what you are doing?” The market is flooded with programmers with less than 5 years of experience being presented by recruiters who know nothing about programming. Using the metric of charity over what I see coming in for interviews, here is what I think is happening. Recruiter sees an applicant that has most of the buzzwords on his resume that the company they are recruiting for is looking for.  But they are missing a critical buzzword, so the recruiter adds this prior to passing the resume on. Having been on a lot of interviews over the years, I have to assume that this works enough of the time to make it worthwhile because there are some places that I’ve interviewed where I haven’t had to prove I was technically capable at all.  In fact, I’ve been on a few interviews where the resume they have for me doesn’t look anything like what I gave the recruiter. And so, those of us on the receiving end of this have to have some quick way of determining, “do you know anything?”</p>
<h2 id="Knowing-the-Concept-Isn’t-Enough"><a href="#Knowing-the-Concept-Isn’t-Enough" class="headerlink" title="Knowing the Concept Isn’t Enough"></a>Knowing the Concept Isn’t Enough</h2><p>Keep in mind, I used to think that knowing the concept WAS enough.  But what I’ve come to realize is that if I know a concept but I don’t know the proper terms for it, I probably don’t know the concept as well as I could.  Sure, I can write code all day long.  But, it doesn’t mean I will write the best code that I can.  It just means that I’ll get the job done. But once I spend the time to learn not just the concept, but the words that describe the concept, I’ve become a student of my craft.  I’ve proven that this is more than a job.  I’ve become a true professional.  Anything less and I’ve proven that I’m a really good hack at best. I realize that this may offend some of you.  So, let me soften this.  I’m not saying you are a bad programmer if you don’t know the proper terms for what you are doing.  What I’m saying is you aren’t as good of a programmer as you could be.  And for those of you who might disagree, the question I have to ask is, “how do you know?”  If you are still defending not having to know this, I have to make the assumption that it is because you are happy not knowing the terms.  Meaning you have nothing to compare where you are to where I am proposing that you should be.  Why not try becoming a student of programming and seeing for yourself if what I am saying has any merit or not.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/08/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> Last week, I posted <a href="/7-c-interview-questions-that-weed-out-the-losers/">7 interview questions for C# programmers.</a>  I guess I forgot that people can’t see in my brain.  So, let me be very explicit this time.  The “weed out the losers” questions are meant to do just that.  Weed out people who have absolutely no business even applying for the job. You would be amazed at how many people interview for a job who have all kinds of cool buzzwords on their resume, but when you ask them about it, they know nothing about the subject.  I’m not sure if this is the recruiter who is representing them trying to help them out by beefing up the resume to get them in the door or if they actually do this themselves.  But, as someone who interviews, I have to have a way of making sure the applicant I’m interviewing is worth interviewing in the first place.  Hopefully, I can do this over the phone in less than a half an hour. So, with that said, if your favorite question isn’t on this list, it is probably because it is a question I would save for some future interview. Also, to those of you who may think that a technical interview doesn’t really tell you if the programmer is a good programmer or not, I have this to say… You are right.  And when I was a younger programmer and was being interviewed with technical questions, I felt the same way.  But now that I’m on the other side of the table, I find that way too often, the people who can pass a technical interview are a lot more likely to be good programmers than the ones who can’t. And finally, I would not rule out an applicant because he got a couple of questions wrong, or didn’t answer them exactly the way I expected.  But if couldn’t answer most of them, that would raise a huge red flag! So, here are 7 JavaScript Interview Questions you should ask first.  Otherwise, you may be wasting your time.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-two-ways-you-might-create-an-object-in-JavaScript"><a href="#What-are-two-ways-you-might-create-an-object-in-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="What are two ways you might create an object in JavaScript?"></a>What are two ways you might create an object in JavaScript?</h2><p>This is a pretty simple question if you’ve been using JavaScript.  Shoot, you should even be able to guess at one of the answers.  But, still, in my experience, there are a lot of people who say they are JavaScript programmers who don’t know how to answer this question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the “new” keyword to call a function.</li>
<li><p>Use the open/close curly braces.</p>
<p>var o = {};</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might want to follow up with, “using the new keyword, at what point is the object created?”  But, as far as questions that weed out, I would consider that something that could wait until I’m really interviewing to discover how deep the applicant’s knowledge goes.</p>
<h2 id="How-would-you-create-an-array"><a href="#How-would-you-create-an-array" class="headerlink" title="How would you create an array?"></a>How would you create an array?</h2><p>This is a similar level question to “How do you create an object.”  And yet, there are some who can answer the first who can’t answer this one. While it is possible to create an array with</p>
<p>var myArray = new Array();</p>
<p>It is a long way of creating an array.  One would hope that the answer included using square brackets.</p>
<p>var myArray = [];</p>
<p>Once again, there are other questions we could ask, but since we only want to know that the applicant is worth further investigation, I would leave the array questioning here.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-variable-hoisting"><a href="#What-is-variable-hoisting" class="headerlink" title="What is variable hoisting?"></a>What is variable hoisting?</h2><p>This one is a slightly harder question to answer, and I wouldn’t expect anyone to be able to answer this.  But again, we are trying to get a quick determination of the applicant’s skill level.  How well do they understand the language they claim to know? Variable hoisting is the term that refers to the fact that no matter where a variable is declared in a scope, the JavaScript engine will move that declaration to the top of the scope.  If you declare a variable in the middle of a function, for example and assign a value to it all in one line:</p>
<p>function foo()<br>{<br>    // a bunch of code here<br>    var a = “abc”;<br>}</p>
<p>The code that actually gets run would look like this:</p>
<p>function foo()<br>{<br>    var a;<br>    // a bunch of code<br>    a = “abc”;<br>}</p>
<h2 id="What-are-the-dangers-of-global-variables-and-how-do-you-protect-against-it"><a href="#What-are-the-dangers-of-global-variables-and-how-do-you-protect-against-it" class="headerlink" title="What are the dangers of global variables and how do you protect against it?"></a>What are the dangers of global variables and how do you protect against it?</h2><p>The danger of global variables is that someone else could create a variable with the same name and overwrite the variable you are using.  This is a bad idea in any language. You prevent this in a number of ways.  The most common would be to create one global variable that all of your other variables live in:</p>
<p>var applicationName = {};</p>
<p>And then any time you need to create a global variable, you attach it to that object.</p>
<p>applicationName.myVariable = “abc”;</p>
<p>The other way you can guard against this is by wrapping all of your code in a self-executing function so that any variables that are declared are declared within that function’s scope.</p>
<p>(function(){<br>   var a = “abc”;<br>})();</p>
<p>In reality, you’ll probably end up using both methods.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-you-iterate-through-members-in-a-JavaScript-object"><a href="#How-do-you-iterate-through-members-in-a-JavaScript-object" class="headerlink" title="How do you iterate through members in a JavaScript object?"></a>How do you iterate through members in a JavaScript object?</h2><p>for(var prop in obj){<br>    // bonus points for hasOwnProperty<br>    if(obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)){<br>        // do something here<br>    }<br>}</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-closure"><a href="#What-is-a-closure" class="headerlink" title="What is a closure?"></a>What is a closure?</h2><p>A closure is what allows a function inside the scope of another function to still be able to see the variables declared in the outer scope even after everything else about that scope has disappeared.  Bonus points if they state something about the dangers of using a closure inside of a for/next loop without declaring a variable to hold the current value of the iteration variable.</p>
<h2 id="Describe-your-experience-unit-testing-JavaScript"><a href="#Describe-your-experience-unit-testing-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Describe your experience unit testing JavaScript"></a>Describe your experience unit testing JavaScript</h2><p>Here we are just trying to find out if they’ve even done unit testing with JavaScript.  It is an open ended question with no particular right answer but it should tell you something in the process.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/08/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> So, once again, the place I am currently working has been interviewing for some more programmers and we’ve had to laugh at some of the answers we’ve received on some pretty simple question. For example, in answer to “How do you create an object in JavaScript?”  One applicant responded, “I always use the WHERE keyword.”  What?!!! And that naturally got us all talking about good interview questions.  How can we tell that the applicant is even worth interviewing? The following questions are not meant to be THE interview.  The questions are meant to shorten the interview process by ensuring the applicant has a basic understanding of the language they will be expected to work with. </p>
<h2 id="C-Interview-Questions"><a href="#C-Interview-Questions" class="headerlink" title="C# Interview Questions"></a>C# Interview Questions</h2><h3 id="1-What-is-the-difference-between-an-Object-and-a-Class"><a href="#1-What-is-the-difference-between-an-Object-and-a-Class" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the difference between an Object and a Class?"></a>1. What is the difference between an Object and a Class?</h3><p>This is an object oriented 101 question.  So if you can’t answer this, I might try a few other questions for show, but you’ve probably already been counted out.  The way I always described the difference between the two is that the Class is like a cookie cutter and an Object is like the cookie.  The class defines what the object is going to do, but the object is the thing actually doing the work. A more technical answer would be that the Class defines the object while the Object is the Class active in memory.</p>
<h3 id="2-What-is-“Polymorphism”"><a href="#2-What-is-“Polymorphism”" class="headerlink" title="2. What is “Polymorphism”?"></a>2. What is “Polymorphism”?</h3><p>This is my first stab at making sure you understand the basics of object oriented programming.  Does your answer at least include the concept of virtual functions?  Here is how I explain polymorphism. Polymorphism gets at the idea that you can have a method in a parent class and a method with the same name in a child class.  If the method in the parent class should be marked virtual and the method in the child class should be marked “overrides.”  At runtime, the decision as to which one is called is based on the type of the object that the method is called from.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/polymorphism.html">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/polymorphism.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some might want to include other concepts</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>But historically, polymorphism has been limited to the basic idea of virtual functions and the applicants response should, at the very least, reflect this answer.</p>
<h3 id="3-What-is-the-difference-between-overload-overrides-and-shadows"><a href="#3-What-is-the-difference-between-overload-overrides-and-shadows" class="headerlink" title="3. What is the difference between overload, overrides, and shadows?"></a>3. What is the difference between overload, overrides, and shadows?</h3><p>Again, this is to get at your understanding of object oriented programming generally and the sometimes confusing keywords in the language. - Overloading gets at the concept that you can have multiple methods with the same name hanging off a given class as long as the methods all have a different signature (parameter types), the code is legal. - Overrides is how polymorphism is implemented. - Shadows flips polymorphism on it’s head.  If you mark a method as shadowed using the “new” keyword, then instead of the method getting called based on the object type, the method gets called based on the variable type that is holding the reference to the object. So, give class A is a parent of class B and both have a method foo() and foo() is marked with the shadows keyword.  If you declare a variable of type A and point that variable to an object of type B, when you call foo off that object, A.foo() will be called.</p>
<h3 id="4-What-is-the-difference-between-the-keyword-“String”-and-the-keyword-“string”"><a href="#4-What-is-the-difference-between-the-keyword-“String”-and-the-keyword-“string”" class="headerlink" title="4. What is the difference between the keyword  “String” and the keyword “string”?"></a>4. What is the difference between the keyword  “String” and the keyword “string”?</h3><p>I work with some pretty sharp guys and even they stumbled on this one.  Do YOU know? When I was teaching C# for a training company, I would say, “The only difference is that ‘string’ turns blue in the editor.”  Of course now that you can configure the editor, that’s not really a good answer.  But you get the point.  Both keywords compile down to the same intermediate language.  Technically, “string” is an alias for “String”.  “String” is the proper class.</p>
<h3 id="5-What-is-“int”-an-alias-for"><a href="#5-What-is-“int”-an-alias-for" class="headerlink" title="5. What is “int” an alias for?"></a>5. What is “int” an alias for?</h3><p>Since we’ve already used the term alias by this point, I’m digging deep to find out just how much you know.  The proper answer is that “int” is an alias for the Int32 type.  I can forgive you if you say “class” but it really isn’t a class.  It is a type.</p>
<h3 id="6-What-is-the-difference-between-a-value-type-and-a-reference-type"><a href="#6-What-is-the-difference-between-a-value-type-and-a-reference-type" class="headerlink" title="6. What is the difference between a value type and a reference type?"></a>6. What is the difference between a value type and a reference type?</h3><p>Once again, I’m trying to find out how well you know what is going on.  Do you just hack at your code until it seems to work, or do you really understand what is happening under the hood? Again, when I was teaching this, the explanation always went something like this: The value of a value type occupies memory on the stack and when you do an assignment from one value type to another the data is copied from one memory location to the other.  Each variable is changed in isolation to the other. A reference type is a variable on the stack that points to memory in the heap that actually holds the value.  When you do an assignment from one reference type to another, only the pointer is copied.  In the end, both variables point to the same location on the heap. If you change the value of a reference type from one variable, the other variable is impacted with the change because it is the same location in memory you are changing. The key part of this answer is that the value of a value type occupies the memory the variable represents and that the value of a reference type is pointed to by the memory that the variable represents.  The stack vs heap issue is secondary and in fact gets clouded by the fact that once you put a value type in a reference type, either by boxing or by including it as a member of a class, the whole stack vs heap question gets quite murky.  But, using stack vs heap as a general way of discussing the main issue is a starting point at the very least.</p>
<h3 id="7-What-is-the-primary-factor-in-making-code-testable"><a href="#7-What-is-the-primary-factor-in-making-code-testable" class="headerlink" title="7. What is the primary factor in making code testable?"></a>7. What is the primary factor in making code testable?</h3><p>OK.  You knew I had to stick this one in here, right?  I doubt most programmers have given this much thought so it is OK if they have to spend some time thinking of the answer. What I’m hoping to hear is that dependencies make code untestable. Simplistic answer?  Maybe.  But the answer to this question, regardless of if it agrees with mine or not, will tell me if they’ve had any experience writing unit tests.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/08/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> I got a question this last week that I answered very briefly but I felt that to answer it completely would take a blog post.  So here’s the blog post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should the author of a piece of code be responsible for more than just unit testing, or does peer review have a play?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loaded question, right?  Obviously, the guy asking this question believes that an author should both unit test AND have peer review.  And I agree.  But to limit the role of a programmer to even those two things is a very narrow view of programming. Then I got to thinking about it and realized that most of what we’d be trying to accomplish with a code review encompasses everything we’d want to include in a list of things a developer is responsible for.  Further, a code review is mostly a review that ensures that 1) the code does what it is supposed to do, and 2) the code is easy to maintain in the future. In other words, all that the word “Peer review” or “Code review” encompasses is largely about code clarity. Code clarity addresses the issue we all have when we pick up a new piece of code.  Can you understand it easily?  I just listened to a <a href="//dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1172">DotNetRocks episode</a> that was all about the fact that we spend most of our time reading code and yet no one is talking about how we might do this better.  One way we can read code better is by writing it more clearly in the first place. Here are 15 ways you can make your code easier to read:</p>
<h2 id="Make-your-code-pretty"><a href="#Make-your-code-pretty" class="headerlink" title="Make your code pretty"></a>Make your code pretty</h2><p>I remember back when I was doing Clipper programming, we had one guy who would always show code that was ready to be printed in a text book.  I mean, regardless of what you had to say about what he had actually coded, the visual presentation of the code was a thing of beauty.  He had us believing that all of his code looked like that.  Then he went to work for some other company and we actually looked at the other code he had written.  It looked just like any other code. But it taught me a lesson.  A lesson I, unfortunately still need to be reminded of.  Pretty code is easier to maintain and implies a lot about the quality of the code.  Just like you wouldn’t go to an interview without wearing a suit because how you dress implies something about how you’ll program, your code should imply the quality by what it looks like before you ever start reading it.</p>
<h2 id="Establish-and-obey-naming-conventions-for-your-code"><a href="#Establish-and-obey-naming-conventions-for-your-code" class="headerlink" title="Establish and obey naming conventions for your code."></a>Establish and obey naming conventions for your code.</h2><p>I’ve written about this before.  Most notably when .NET first came out in the article about <a href="/hungarian-notation-use-what-works-spit-out-the-bones/">Hungarian Notation</a>.  As I point out in that article, not using Hungarian notation doesn’t mean you don’t have any standards.  Sure, you don’t want to prefix all of your integers with a lower case “I”, because you don’t care what kind of number it is.  But it is valuable to prefix a button with “button” so that it is easier to find in your Intellisense, or if you need to search your code for what you named it, it is much easier to find all of the buttons in your code this way. But there is another reason to establish and obey naming conventions.  Once you’ve done this, it makes it easier for everyone who is using those common conventions to read your code. For example, where I work, we have what I consider a very odd naming convention.  All of our POCO classes (we generate this ourselves because we are using DB2) are all UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE_SEPARATED.  And all our properties of POCO collections are named UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE_SEPARATEDs.  It used to drive me crazy, mostly because I use <a href="/resharper">ReSharper</a> religiously and the default rules aren’t setup to handle this odd convention.  But, it is a standard and, I can tell you now, you open a file that is using a POCO and you know you are dealing with a POCO.  No question about it! While I still don’t recommend the practice, I tell you that example because it illustrates how much a coding standard can instantly tell you something about the code you are working on before you ever start reading the code.</p>
<h2 id="Establish-and-obey-a-common-architecture"><a href="#Establish-and-obey-a-common-architecture" class="headerlink" title="Establish and obey a common architecture."></a>Establish and obey a common architecture.</h2><p>One of the biggest problems I have in reading other people’s code is if I can’t understand why they put things where they put them.  But having a common architecture that is easy to explain helps alleviate a lot of this problem.  One of the reasons I like working with frameworks is because much of the time these decisions are already made for you.  For example, just having a simple three tiered architecture that separates the View, Business Rules, and Data Access into different parts of your code can go a long way toward making code easy to read.  Within this basic framework you can layer in Model View Presenter, Model View Controller or any other design patterns.  Follow the mantra, “A place for everything and everything in its place” and your code will be much easier to follow.</p>
<h2 id="Name-objects-as-nouns-methods-as-verbs"><a href="#Name-objects-as-nouns-methods-as-verbs" class="headerlink" title="Name objects as nouns, methods as verbs."></a>Name objects as nouns, methods as verbs.</h2><p>This is so basic that I almost feel like I should have to write this here.  But I still see the principle violate all of the time.  So, here it is.  Obviously, if you aren’t following an object oriented methodology.  Say you are doing Functional or Procedural programming, you’ll need to adapt this rule to your environment.  But for OOP guys and gals.  Stop breaking this rule.  It is a sign of immaturity.</p>
<h2 id="Name-variable-what-they-are"><a href="#Name-variable-what-they-are" class="headerlink" title="Name variable what they are."></a>Name variable what they are.</h2><p>Similarly, stop with the short variable names unless you are using a language that is still so archaic as to require it.  I’ve written about this before.  Twice actually.  <a href="/tags/naming-conventions/">With rants about using i, j and k as variable names</a>.  The point here is that you want to be able to read your code and to do that your code has to tell you something about what you are doing.  Short variable names almost always never assist in code readability.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-include-a-noun-in-your-method"><a href="#Don’t-include-a-noun-in-your-method" class="headerlink" title="Don’t include a noun in your method."></a>Don’t include a noun in your method.</h2><p>This is different from just saying that method should be verbs.  There are a lot of places where I’ve seen code that has a verb AND a noun as a method name.  If you have a method that has both a noun and a verb in it, your class is probably trying to do too much. Wouldn’t it look funny if you had a Person class that had a method in it called FirstNameToLower()?</p>
<h2 id="Establish-a-cyclomatic-complexity-threshold-for-your-methods-and-obey-them-religiously"><a href="#Establish-a-cyclomatic-complexity-threshold-for-your-methods-and-obey-them-religiously" class="headerlink" title="Establish a cyclomatic complexity threshold for your methods and obey them religiously."></a>Establish a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> threshold for your methods and obey them religiously.</h2><p>Cyclomatic complexity takes into account how many statements have to be executed and, most importantly, how many conditionals have to be executed in your code.  The easiest way to reduce cyclomatic complexity is to reduce the number of conditions.  But aside from that, you can make your code much more readable by eliminating nesting where ever possible. One of my favorites is instead of writing code that looks something like this:</p>
<p>void SomeMethod()<br>{<br>   if(x != y)<br>   {<br>      // do stuff here<br>   }<br>}</p>
<p>You can make your code much more readable by writing it like this:</p>
<p>void SomeMethod()<br>{<br>   if(x == y) return;<br>   // do stuff here<br>}</p>
<p>Similarly, instead of nesting when this doesn’t work, as with while statements that contain other while statements, why not create a method for each while statement?</p>
<h2 id="Make-code-“self-documenting”"><a href="#Make-code-“self-documenting”" class="headerlink" title="Make code “self-documenting”"></a>Make code “self-documenting”</h2><p>That is, if you feel your code needs a comment, you probably have violated one or more of the other readability suggestions.  This is not to say that you should never add comments, but they should not be a replacement for readable code.  I generally leave comments for WHY I did something and leave the WHAT I did to the code.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-add-comments-for-things-that-you-can-deduce-by-reading-the-code"><a href="#Don’t-add-comments-for-things-that-you-can-deduce-by-reading-the-code" class="headerlink" title="Don’t add comments for things that you can deduce by reading the code."></a>Don’t add comments for things that you can deduce by reading the code.</h2><p>“This next line increments loopVar by 1” does no one any good and could eventually end up being litter in your code that makes the code harder to read.  Why?  Because it is possible for loopVar to get renamed, or removed and the comment could stick around forever.  Until we get compilers that verify our comments as well as our executable code, referencing variables in comments is a generally bad practice that should be avoided.</p>
<h2 id="Is-the-code-SOLID"><a href="#Is-the-code-SOLID" class="headerlink" title="Is the code SOLID?"></a>Is the code <a href="/pluralsightSOLID">SOLID</a>?</h2><ul>
<li>Single Responsibility of classes</li>
<li>Open/Close Principle</li>
<li>Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
<li>Interface Segregation Principle</li>

<h2 id="Is-the-code-testable"><a href="#Is-the-code-testable" class="headerlink" title="Is the code testable?"></a>Is the code testable?</h2><p>If you follow all of the rules above, the code should be easy to test.  But, this is something that you should review your code for explicitly.</p>
<h2 id="Will-the-code-fail"><a href="#Will-the-code-fail" class="headerlink" title="Will the code fail?"></a>Will the code fail?</h2><p>Can anyone write code that uses any particular method that would make the method crash, throw an exception, or otherwise do something that was never intended?</p>
<h2 id="Code-duplications"><a href="#Code-duplications" class="headerlink" title="Code duplications."></a>Code duplications.</h2><p>I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty sure I’ve got code that looks practically the same littered throughout my code base.  One of my current goals is to make myself create a new method any time I’m getting ready to copy and paste more than three lines of code.</p>
<h2 id="100-Code-Coverage"><a href="#100-Code-Coverage" class="headerlink" title="100% Code Coverage"></a>100% Code Coverage</h2><p>Assuming you have unit test, do you have 100% code coverage on all of the methods that have a cyclomatic complexity score greater than 1?  I’m talking about code you’ve written.  I’ve written before about <a href="/100-code-coverage/">what code should be tested</a> and what code doesn’t need to be tested.</p>
<h2 id="Learn-the-vocabulary-of-your-language"><a href="#Learn-the-vocabulary-of-your-language" class="headerlink" title="Learn the vocabulary of your language"></a>Learn the vocabulary of your language</h2><p>John Sonmez wrote a very compelling article in 2013 about <a href="//simpleprogrammer.com/2013/04/14/what-makes-code-readable-not-what-you-think/">what makes code readable</a>.  In it he says that just like when we learn to read.  Code that is readable by a senior level developer may not be readable by an entry level developer simply because the entry level developer doesn’t have a firm grasp of the language.  Like John, I’ve been criticized for using the ternary operator because it is too terse.  Not descriptive enough.  Un-readable.  And I’ve always responded that arguing that the syntax isn’t clear is like arguing that a sentence isn’t clear because it uses a word you aren’t familiar with.  The word may actually be the perfect word for what the author is trying to communicate.  Your understanding of that word does not make the writing bad.  It just means the reader has some more learning to do. What else have you found makes your code more readable?  Leave me a comment below.</p>
