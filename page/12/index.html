        <p>For months now I have been suffering from the dreaded random computer freeze.  It has gotten progressively worse.  Everything I’ve tried to do to fix the problem has failed.  I know what you’re thinking too.  “Must be a virus.”  Yeah, except I have run multiple virus checkers and come up empty.  I read someplace else that maybe it was a driver issue.  OK, but which driver?  Memory?  I guess that is possible, but not likely.  I’ll admit that is one thing I didn’t check. The great thing about this issue is that it has caused me to write better code, because the code I’m currently working on would fail as it was writing to the database, even though the database is on the same computer.  So, now I make it try three times, with 2 minutes in between, before giving up.  Fortunately, it isn’t a routine that NEEDS to be fast.  In fact, it is better if it is not. <img src="/uploads/2015/11/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Another-Problem"><a href="#Another-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Another Problem"></a>Another Problem</h2><p>I’ve also noticed, more recently, that the CTRL key on my keyboard doesn’t want to work.  CTRL-C and CTRL-V often result in “c” or “v” being typed out unless I’m really intentional about pressing the keys.  Not the best way to go about programming.  Fortunately, I’m not using this computer to do my regular work (I’m currently working on-site with the client’s computer).  So, for the little bit of usage, I could live with it.  Besides, I’m cheap. Now, when I first got <a href="/backlitKeyboard">this keyboard</a>, I was really impressed.  The backlit keyboard was cool, but what I really liked was the mechanical keys.  So much smoother.  So, I was a little disappointed when I was thinking about replacing it.  And if I did replace it, should I get another of the same kind, or should I get something else? So, I procrastinated.</p>
<h2 id="Enough-Is-Enough"><a href="#Enough-Is-Enough" class="headerlink" title="Enough Is Enough!"></a>Enough Is Enough!</h2><p>Finally, a couple of weeks ago, I got so tired of not being able to copy and paste correctly, that I broke down and went to Amazon to see what is currently available.  This is when the <a href="/logitechWave">Logitech Wave</a> series caught my eye. I’ve always liked the idea of ergonomic keyboards, but when I’ve tried the split keyboard, I just didn’t like them.  Yes, maybe I could get used to one.  But, I don’t want to have to get used to one.  The Logitech Wave is a nice compromise.  It FEELS mostly like a regular keyboard because the keys aren’t split.  But it has a slight curve or wave (hence the name) that conforms to what your fingers want to do instead of making your fingers comply with a straight row of keys.</p>
<h2 id="So-What-Is-It-Like"><a href="#So-What-Is-It-Like" class="headerlink" title="So What Is It Like?"></a>So What Is It Like?</h2><p>So far, I like it enough.  I can’t say if it helps with carpal tunnel because I don’t really suffer from that problem.  It is a keyboard, it wasn’t all that expensive. It is wireless, so I was able to get it setup without crawling under my desk (I did have to crawl under my desk to unplug the old keyboard!).  Honestly, the only issue I’ve had was during the setup.  I unpacked the keyboard and the mouse (it comes with a wireless mouse) and realized, I didn’t know where the receiver part was that plugs into a USB port.  I looked back in the box for it, was it in one of the bags I hadn’t opened yet?  No.  Hmm.  Where could it be? Oh, there it is.  Stuck in the cardboard.  Seriously, this thing is SO small, if you don’t pay attention, you could lose it.  And I almost did before I had ever even gotten it installed!</p>
<h2 id="What’s-This-Got-To-Do-With-Computer-Freezes"><a href="#What’s-This-Got-To-Do-With-Computer-Freezes" class="headerlink" title="What’s This Got To Do With Computer Freezes?"></a>What’s This Got To Do With Computer Freezes?</h2><p>Over the rest of the day, I noticed, my computer isn’t freezing any more.  Maybe I’m just imagining things. But, I’ve been using this, as of this writing, for over a week.  I’ve used it for at least 2 hours every night.  I’m using it now to write this post.  I wrote last week’s post.  Seriously, my computer no longer freezes.  Whoda thunk?</p>

        <p>I’ve written that <a href="/tags/angular-js/">I’m using Angular</a> to write a couple applications before.  One at my main contract and a couple side projects.  I know I’m kind of late to the game, but one of my frustrations with the documentation around Angular is that very little of the sample code that you can find on the Internet shows the sample using anything close to a best practice.  That’s the danger of writing about something you are too familiar with. So, in this post, I’d like to cover a few best practices that I’ve discovered, or implemented in my own code, and explain in a bit more detail what is going on inside the controller.  I concentrate on the controller because this is a place that will be used the most.  Once you understand it, the rest of what you need to know will trickle down to services, factories, and directives.</p>
<h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a><img src="/uploads/2015/10/image4.png" alt="image" title="image"></h2><h2 id="IIFEs"><a href="#IIFEs" class="headerlink" title="IIFEs"></a>IIFEs</h2><p>The first thing you’ll almost never see in the demos, but you might pick up on eventually, is that you should always write your angular code inside of and IIFE.  What’s an IIFE you ask?  IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression.  The most common looks like this:</p>
<p>(function(){<br>    // your code goes here<br>})();</p>
<p>Why do we do this?  So that we can declare variables that are “global” to everything inside of the IIFE without polluting the global namespace.  If you follow the rest of the tips in this article, you shouldn’t end up writing any kind of global variables.  But, there is another good reason for using an IIFE.  You can pass parameters into it.  The most common implementation I use is that I pass any global variables I need for the code inside as parameters.  This keeps JSHint happy without having to specify global variables as comments or putting them in a configuration file.  Since “angular”:</p>
<p>(function(angular){<br> // your code goes here<br>})(window.angular);</p>
<h2 id="Single-Responsibility-Applies-to-Files"><a href="#Single-Responsibility-Applies-to-Files" class="headerlink" title="Single Responsibility Applies to Files"></a>Single Responsibility Applies to Files</h2><p>Another big problem I see with a lot of samples, is that they mix controllers and directives and modules declarations all together.  At one level I get it, why separate them when it is just a small demo.  On the other hand, doing inadvertently promotes bad code to the masses. How much code have you seen that looks like:</p>
<p>var app = angular.module(‘app’, [<br>    // Angular modules<br>    // Custom modules<br>    // 3rd Party Modules<br>    ]);<br>app.config([‘<br>    function () {<br>        // code here<br>    });<br>angular.module(‘Controllers’).controller(‘Controller’,[ function () {<br>   // code here<br>    }]);<br>angular.module(‘Controllers’).controller(‘controllerName’,<br>    [‘$scope’, function ($scope)<br>    {<br>       // Code here<br>    }]);</p>
<p>When they should specify what should be in a separate file.  Maybe by wrapping them in IIFEs.</p>
<p>// top level app.js file<br>(function(angular){<br>angular.module(‘app’, [<br>    // Angular modules<br>    // Custom modules<br>    // 3rd Party Modules<br>    ]);<br>})(window.angular);</p>
<p>// config.js that lives in a file parallel to app.js<br>(function(angular){<br>angular.module(‘app’).config([‘ function () { // code here }); })(window.angular); // controllers holder that lives parallel to app.js (function(angular){ angular.module(‘Controllers’).controller(‘Controller’,[ function () { // code here }]); })(window.angular); // controller that lives parallel to the view it is associated with (function(angular){ angular.module(‘Controllers’).controller(‘controllerName’, [‘$scope’, function ($scope) { // Code here }]); })(window.angular);</p>
<h2 id="Namespace-Everything"><a href="#Namespace-Everything" class="headerlink" title="Namespace Everything"></a>Namespace Everything</h2><p>As I’ve already hinted at in the code above, I place my controllers and the views they are attached to in separate directories based on the route or state that I will use to get to them.  I use states, so to be clear the state does not necessarily represent the url that I will be using to access the view.  This works out pretty nicely because for every state, there is a directory and for every sub state, there is a sub directory.  Each directory generally has two files.  controller.js and view.html.  When I specify the name of the controller, I use dot notation to represent where it is in the directory structure.  Similarly, when I specify the state in app.config(), I use the same dot notation.  So if my state were ‘edit.contact’ you should expect to see a directory structure of ‘edit/contact’ with the two files inside of it.</p>
<h2 id="ControllerAs"><a href="#ControllerAs" class="headerlink" title="ControllerAs"></a>ControllerAs</h2><p>I’ve only seen this explained in one place (<a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight of course</a>) where this is explained in a way that I could grasp. Here’s the deal.  What you first need to understand is how the code you write in angular relates to the code you would write in JavaScript without the framework.  (BTW, one complaint I’ve heard from hiring managers is that while they can find people who can write Angular, they can’t find people who can write Angular AND understand JavaScript.  So much is hidden from us by using Angular.  If you want to be awesome at Angular, be awesome at JavaScript.) So, let’s sketch out a basic controller.</p>
<p>(function ()<br>{<br>    ‘use strict’;<br>    angular.module(‘Controllers’).controller(‘edit.contacts’,<br>        [‘$scope’, function ($scope)<br>    {<br>        // Your controller code here<br>    }]);</p>
<p>})();</p>
<p>What is happening here?  Well what you’ve essentially done is create an anonymous constructor for your controller.</p>
<p>Let’s rearrange some code so that you can see this more clearly.</p>
<p>(function ()<br>{<br>    ‘use strict’;</p>
<pre><code>editContacts.$inject = \[&apos;$scope&apos;\];
function editContacts($scope)
{
    // your code here
};

angular.module(&apos;Controllers&apos;).controller(&apos;edit.contacts&apos;, editContacts);
</code></pre><p>})();</p>
<p>So, now the code looks like regular JavaScript.  And if I told you that editContacts was the object constructor, the next thing that you might expect is that you could then write code that looked something like this:</p>
<p>(function ()<br>{<br>    ‘use strict’;</p>
<pre><code>editContacts.$inject = \[&apos;$scope&apos;\];
function editContacts($scope)
{
    var self = this;
    function someMethod(){
        self.variableName = &apos;foo&apos;;
    };

    self.someMethod = someMethod;
    // your code here
};

angular.module(&apos;Controllers&apos;).controller(&apos;edit.contacts&apos;, editContacts);
</code></pre><p>})();</p>
<p>This is the way I like to write JavaScript classes, but you can use any method you prefer.  It is just plain old JavaScript at this point. The other piece that might need some explaining is the ‘editContacts.$inject’ thing.  This is just an alternate way of specifying the services that need to be injected into your constructor.  I haven’t decided if I like using this way, or if I like having them specified in the controller definition at the bottom.  By leaving the injection at the bottom, I am left with code that looks mostly like plain old JavaScript.  By leaving them at the top, I can see that what I’m injecting matches the parameters I am expecting.  Of course, if you are willing to throw some external tools into the mix, you can have that line created for you automatically at build time. So, under the hood, what Angular is doing for you is looking for the controller by the name that you gave it and calling the function associated with it using the ‘new’ keyword.  If you want some of your functions and methods exposed to the view, you need to attach them to the $scope, which is why we need to inject it as a parameter to our constructor.  But, if you use the ControllerAs keyword, it assigns the object to a variable the the name you specified as the ‘As’ and attaches it to $scope.  What this means is that you almost never have to pass in the $scope object to your constructor and all of your public methods and fields are available to the view for free using the syntax ‘asName.variableName’.</p>
<h2 id="Using-Controllers-in-Directives"><a href="#Using-Controllers-in-Directives" class="headerlink" title="Using Controllers in Directives"></a>Using Controllers in Directives</h2><p>The final piece I want to talk about today gets back to my discussion about demos that don’t use good coding practices.  Most directive demos that use controllers write the controller inline.  But you don’t have to do it this way, and I would recommend that you don’t.  Controllers should be in their own file.  Separation of concerns and Single Responsibility.  You define  your controller just like you would any other controller in the separate file.  I define them using the controller function hanging off the directive object</p>
<p>directive(‘directiveName’)<br>    .controller(controllerDefinitionHere);</p>
<p>And then use the name of the directive in the controller property in my directive code.</p>

        <p>I heard this so frequently, I decided it is time to write about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(When writing web applications)  Business rules always belong on the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the last conversations I had at the last place I was working was on this same issue.  And, I had a similar reaction a couple of years ago when I was doing a Selenium testing presentation and mentioned that the organization I was currently working for put all of the code on the client side and that the only thing the server did was save the data. Maybe you believe the same thing? Nothing is ever that cut and dry. <img src="/uploads/2015/10/image3.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="First-Rule-of-Rhetoric"><a href="#First-Rule-of-Rhetoric" class="headerlink" title="First Rule of Rhetoric"></a>First Rule of Rhetoric</h2><p>Now, the first rule of rhetoric, and the rule you must always keep in mind is this.  Whenever someone states an absolute, it probably isn’t true.  Including this one <img src="/uploads/2015/10/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile">. Here’s the deal. At one point there were good reasons for not putting business rules on the client side.  Chief among them was that JavaScript was slow.  If if you accounted for the round trip time, performing business logic on the server was generally slower. Another reason it was nearly never a good idea to put the business rules on the client is that no one really knew how to write good, structured, testable JavaScript.  But JavaScript has grown up and this is not the problem it once was. And finally, and the only reason we have left, is that despite many attempts to obfuscate JavaScript, at the end of the day, JavaScript is available for anyone who wants to, to read and steal trade secrets from.  Things have gotten better, but the truth remains, if I really want to, I can figure out what your JavaScript code is doing.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-a-Business-Rule"><a href="#What-Is-a-Business-Rule" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Business Rule?"></a>What Is a Business Rule?</h2><p>OK, so I’ve shown that most of the old rules don’t exist.  We’ll come back to the third old rule later.  What I want to discuss is the chief, “it depends” issue. What, exactly, qualifies as a business rule? I have to admit, this question has bothered me for years.</p>
<h3 id="Three-Tiered"><a href="#Three-Tiered" class="headerlink" title="Three Tiered"></a>Three Tiered</h3><p>Take a look at a typical description of a three tiered architecture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>View &lt;–&gt; Business Rules &lt;–&gt; Data Access</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know about you, but most of the applications I work on, the business logic layer does little more than pass the data from the Data Access Layer up to the View and back again.  There MAY be some transformations along the way.  It might combine data in a particular way.  But, really, the Business Logic Layer, strictly speaking, isn’t doing anything I would be uncomfortable letting my competitors know about.  There are only a few instances where I could argue that putting that code on the server was going to speed things up in any significant way.</p>
<h3 id="Model-View-Whatever"><a href="#Model-View-Whatever" class="headerlink" title="Model View Whatever"></a>Model View Whatever</h3><p>Then there is the Model View Whatever patterns.  You know, MVC, MVVM, etc.  In this pattern, our business rules either get stuck in the controller or we put them in classes external to this pattern.  Often this code does little more than decide what elements should be enabled or disabled, assist in validation, and auto populate fields that the user could populate themselves but we do it to make life easier for them. Once again, I have to ask, what about a business rule needs to be hidden or would work faster if we put it on the server?</p>
<h2 id="Who-Is-Using-Your-Application"><a href="#Who-Is-Using-Your-Application" class="headerlink" title="Who Is Using Your Application?"></a>Who Is Using Your Application?</h2><p>Most web applications today are built by organizations to be used by themselves in Intranet environments.  In the last organization I worked for, there was no danger that someone would steal our code.  Most of them had no idea how to do it, and if they did, they wouldn’t be able to read it anyhow. By asking the question, “Who is using this application?” You are really asking, “What’s the risk of putting code on the client side?”  Most of the time for most of our code in most of the organizations, including even publicly facing web sites, there is very little risk involved in putting all of our code on the client side.</p>
<h2 id="Is-There-Any-Advantage"><a href="#Is-There-Any-Advantage" class="headerlink" title="Is There Any Advantage?"></a>Is There Any Advantage?</h2><p>Which comes down to the final question that needs to be asked.  Is there any advantage to putting code on the server instead of the client, or the other way around? In most cases, I think you will find, that the advantage of putting code on the client side far outweighs the advantages of putting that same code on the server side.  In some extreme cases, you may find that there is code that absolutely needs to live on the server.</p>
<h2 id="Maybe-I’m-Missing-Something"><a href="#Maybe-I’m-Missing-Something" class="headerlink" title="Maybe I’m Missing Something?"></a>Maybe I’m Missing Something?</h2><p>OK.  So, maybe I’m missing something.  Do you agree or not?  Why?  Leave a comment.</p>

        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I posted <a href="/7-reasons-every-programmer-needs-to-learn-javascript/">7 Reasons Every Programmer Needs to Learn JavaScript</a>.  In the comments, Dean tried to refute my arguments first by claiming that my sources for JavaScript’s popularity were “a problem” because JavaScript is used in combination with other languages.  A point I refute in the comments.  But then he goes on to claim that “JavaScript is poorly suited for client side applications” because JavaScript is “Single Threaded”.  At this point, I just sighed and realized that Dean doesn’t want to learn JavaScript and that there MUST be some reason I’m not seeing for why he is so critical of JavaScript. But then Brandon jumped in and offered a very clear defense of JavaScript on the server side.  Nearly making this post unnecessary. And yet, there are things that were not said, and most people will never see the great comments that Brandon supplied.  And so we look at Multi-Threaded JavaScript in depth. <img src="/uploads/2015/10/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="JavaScript-vs-Node-js"><a href="#JavaScript-vs-Node-js" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript vs Node.js"></a>JavaScript vs Node.js</h2><p>In Brandon’s first comment, he accurately points out that it is not fair to equate JavaScript the language to Node.js the environment.  This is because Node.js does actually spin up multiple threads as needed to handle the incoming traffic.  In fact, there have been several performance test comparing Node.js to ASP.NET applications which have all found that Node.js either keeps up with, or out performs ASP.NET.  This is because of the way that traffic is handled.  In ASP.NET the default implementation is for an incoming request to block until the response for that request is sent back to the client, while the default mechanism in Node is for the request to NOT block.  In node, everything that should be none-blocking is none-blocking.  This is a HUGE win, essentially making node “Multi-threaded” in the places that matter without having to think about it.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a simple example.  You post data from the web browser to the server that needs to go into a database.  In ASP.NET, the default way of handling this would be to receive the request, send the data to the database, wait for the return value from the database, and return to the server.  All as a blocking call. In Node.js, you would/could see this default behavior.  Information is sent to the server, the server sends to the database asynchronously and immediately returns to the client.  Of course, there are error handling issues that need to be addressed here, but the main point is that you don’t HAVE to wait and you probably shouldn’t.  If you need to send an error message back, that would be handled separately. So, I ask, which is going to appear to be faster?</p>
<h2 id="Who-Needs-Multi-threading"><a href="#Who-Needs-Multi-threading" class="headerlink" title="Who Needs Multi-threading?"></a>Who Needs Multi-threading?</h2><p>OK.  So, we’ve addressed the environment issue.  But now I have to ask, when is the last time you really needed your application to be multi-threaded?  I can count the number of times that I used multi-threading capabilities in one of my applications (sever side or desktop application) one two hands in the last 28 years of programming.  The need for multi-threading is quite low relative to the number of programs written.  And even if you COULD write a multi-threaded application, the benefit compared to the complexity in your code tends to be relatively minor.</p>
<h2 id="Multi-threading-If-You-Need-It-–-Client-Side"><a href="#Multi-threading-If-You-Need-It-–-Client-Side" class="headerlink" title="Multi-threading If You Need It – Client Side"></a>Multi-threading If You Need It – Client Side</h2><p>A little known and often under-utilized feature of JavaScript on the client side is Web Workers, which allow us to run a JavaScript file in a separate thread on the client side.  The “disadvantage” of using workers is that 1) they can’t access the DOM and 2) you have to use messaging to have the parent page and the worker talk to each other.  If you absolutely needed multi-threading on the Client Side, this would be the way to make it work today.  If you structure your code correctly, the separation from the DOM shouldn’t be an issue and messaging is a great way of communicating between a View Model and the View, even without the web worker process.</p>
<h2 id="Multi-threading-If-You-Need-It-–-Server-Side"><a href="#Multi-threading-If-You-Need-It-–-Server-Side" class="headerlink" title="Multi-threading If You Need It – Server Side"></a>Multi-threading If You Need It – Server Side</h2><p>In the response I initially added to the multi-threading issue, I suggested running child processes.  This is the server side equivalent of using a worker process on the client side.  You spawn off some worker processes, wait for them all to return, collect the information they provide, and continue on.  As was pointed out, this is not “true multi-threading” because in a real multi-threaded application, every thread has access to the same memory space.  But you could argue that this is a good thing too.  There are a lot of issues with multiple threads accessing the same shared memory.  I’m not sure I would want the average programmer ABLE to do this.</p>
<h2 id="Today-is-Not-Tomorrow"><a href="#Today-is-Not-Tomorrow" class="headerlink" title="Today is Not Tomorrow"></a>Today is Not Tomorrow</h2><p>Just because JavaScript doesn’t handle REAL multi-threading today, doesn’t mean this won’t be added in the future.  The language is still evolving.  I could see a point in the next 5 years where this capability is added in, or a framework is created that will make this available, or both.</p>
<h2 id="Only-Use-Multi-Threading-Where-You-Need-It"><a href="#Only-Use-Multi-Threading-Where-You-Need-It" class="headerlink" title="Only Use Multi-Threading Where You Need It"></a>Only Use Multi-Threading Where You Need It</h2><p>OK.  But what if you REALLY need Multi-threading capabilities? As was pointed out, then JavaScript may not be the right language for the job.  But then, you could easily argue that C#, Java, and many other languages aren’t either.  If you REALLY need that kind of speed, you probably want to drop down to C/C++ or even Assembly Language.  But why not mix and match.  It is rarely the case that your entire application needs to be multi-threaded.  In my experience, it is only some small percentage of the overall application that needs that ability.  So, why not create a node module that does the multi-threaded bit and wire it into your broader JavaScript application?</p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-It-Up"><a href="#Wrapping-It-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping It Up"></a>Wrapping It Up</h2><p>Clearly, JavaScript is a young language and Node.js is a young environment.  There are still issues that need to be worked out.  But for as young as it is, they have some pretty robust capabilities “out-of-the-box” that will only get better in the future. I’m excited and optimistic.  Excited about the potential and optimistic about the future capabilities for threading in JavaScript. But maybe you aren’t.  You know what, while I think it might be a career mistake, it is your career.  You don’t have to agree with me.  And since neither of us are omniscient, only time will tell which of us made the better choice.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Last week I mentioned that it is possible to <a href="/7-reasons-every-programmer-needs-to-learn-javascript/">create a desktop application using JavaScript</a> and that I had actually started working on an application that used Angular and Bootstrap for the presentation layer.  I actually have enough of that working that I can share the “how-to” with you. <img src="/uploads/2015/10/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Why-Would-You-Do-This"><a href="#Why-Would-You-Do-This" class="headerlink" title="Why Would You Do This?"></a>Why Would You Do This?</h2><p>Well, I don’t know why YOU would do this, but the reason I’m doing this is because the more I do on the web, the less able I am to work with Windows Form, and I haven’t even bothered learning WPF.  I decided several years ago that I would niche down over web technologies.  And yet, I want to write this desktop application.  I tried to use Windows Form, which I am most familiar with, and just got frustrated.  I want to use a grid control.  But what I want to do with the control is something more like what I would do with Angular’s ui-grid than what I can do with the grid control built into Windows Form. I’m sure someone who really knew the desktop side of the fence would be able to do what I want to do.  But I want to leverage what I know.  And eventually, I may move the whole thing to Node.js even though to get the thing up and running, I am going to use C# for the main processing.</p>
<h2 id="Rendering-HTML"><a href="#Rendering-HTML" class="headerlink" title="Rendering HTML"></a>Rendering HTML</h2><p>The first step toward getting all of this working is to just get HTML to render inside of a Windows Form (or WPF) executable.  I decided to use Windows Forms because I don’t need any of the WPF goodness that WPF would give me.  But you could tweak most of the setup I’m going to give you so that it would work with WPF if that’s your preferred platform. So, let’s start out by creating a Windows Form based application.  Once you have the project loaded, you’ll want to grab the <a href="//www.nuget.org/packages/CefSharp.WinForms/">CefSharp Windows Forms DLL’s and related files</a>.  You can use NuGet to get these installed.  Just search for, “CefSharp.WinForms”. Because chromium uses Win32 or Win64 based C++ DLLs, you’ll need to configure your project to run as one or the other project.  This part was a little tricky.  What I found was that just changing the project settings for the default configuration named “Any CPU” was not enough.  What you need to do is to create a new project named “x64” or “x32” and change the settings there. Try compiling now, before you add any code.  If you’ve configured the project correctly with the CefSharp DLLs it should compile. The next thing you want to do is to insert the Chromium Browser control into the form.  Yes, it is a control like any other control.  No, you won’t find it on your toolbar.  No, it isn’t worth adding to the toolbar.  It is the only control that is going to be on the form so all you need to do is add it to the form using a few lines of code. First, add a private variable to hold the browser control.  It doesn’t need to be a member variable to get the HTML to render, but you’ll want it to be private later on.  So, just make it private to start with. Then, in your Load() method, add the following code:</p>
<p>private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br>{<br>    // Initialize CefSharp<br>     Cef.Initialize();</p>
<pre><code>// Create a new browser window
_browser = 
    new ChromiumWebBrowser(&quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;);

// Add the new browser window to the form
Controls.Add(_browser);
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>You will also need code in your FormClosing() method.  You can create this in Visual Studio by selecting it from the dropdowns in the upper right corner of the code window.</p>
<p>private void Form1_FormClosing(object sender, EventArgs e)<br>{<br>    Cef.Shutdown();<br>}</p>
<p>OK.  Compile and run.  You should be able to load the Google web site and see it in your Windows Form.</p>
<h2 id="Using-Our-Own-Files"><a href="#Using-Our-Own-Files" class="headerlink" title="Using Our Own Files"></a>Using Our Own Files</h2><p>OK, so we’ve proven that we can render HTML inside of a Windows Form application.  But that won’t do us much good if we want to run code on our own.  Most of the places on the web that talk about loading HTML inside of a desktop application using Chromium suggest that you copy the HTML files over as content and use the file:// protocol to load them.  But there are two problems with doing that.  First, I don’t want the files generally accessible to whoever has this installed.  What if someone decides to change those files? The second problem I have is even worse.  Assuming I could live with the files being available on the file system, Angular doesn’t work from the file system.  It wants to run from <a href="http://somedomain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://somedomain/</a>.  So at the very least, we need for our files to LOOK like they’ve been served from a web server. Fortunately, we can solve both of these problems.</p>
<h3 id="Make-Our-Files-Resources"><a href="#Make-Our-Files-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Make Our Files Resources"></a>Make Our Files Resources</h3><p>To start with, we’ll just add one file.  Since it will be the beginning of our main application, name the file index.html and place it in a directory called “web” off the root of your project.  Put enough HTML in there that you’ll know the file actually got loaded. Then in the file properties, mark the file as an “Embedded Resource” instead of “Content” To load this file as a resource, you’ll use code that looks something like this:</p>
<p>var assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();<br>var textStream = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream<br>                 (“TopLevelNamespace.web.index.html”);</p>
<h3 id="Make-it-LOOK-Like-it-Came-From-a-Server"><a href="#Make-it-LOOK-Like-it-Came-From-a-Server" class="headerlink" title="Make it LOOK Like it Came From a Server"></a>Make it LOOK Like it Came From a Server</h3><p>This is where some of the magic starts to happen.  The Chromium APIs have code that will let you register a pre-canned response object with a URL using a dictionary.  So, all we need to do is change the text string that we returned in the code above into a response object and register it with Chromium. The code to do that looks like this:</p>
<p>var factory = (DefaultResourceHandlerFactory)(browser.ResourceHandlerFactory);<br>if (factory == null) return;<br>var response = ResourceHandler.FromStream(textStream);<br>factory.RegisterHandler(“<a href="http://local/&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://local/&quot;</a>, response);</p>
<p>And now, when we tell Chromium to load “<a href="http://local/”" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://local/”</a> it  will render the index.html file from our EXE. Cool! Now, loading each file like this is going to get rather tedious pretty fast.  So what we need is a mechanism for loading all of the files in our web directory automatically.  For this we need to be able to iterate over all of our resources in the web namespace and register them with an associated “http://” tag. Since the best that we can do is get a list of all of the resources in our assembly, we will have to do some filtering to only register stuff in the “web” namespace.  But, there is another issue.  All of the resources are going to be listed as “TopLevelNamespace.web.subnamespace.filename.extension” and we want to register them as “<a href="http://local/subnamespace/filename.extension”" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://local/subnamespace/filename.extension”</a>.  So there is a bit of string manipulation that we need to go through to register everything correctly.</p>
<p>// Get the list of resources<br>var resourceNames = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()<br>    .GetManifestResourceNames();</p>
<p>// For each resource<br>foreach (var resource in resourceNames)<br>{<br>    // If it isn’t in the “web” namespace, skip it.<br>    if (!resource.StartsWith(“TopLevelNamespace.web”))<br>        continue;</p>
<pre><code>// Strip out the namespace that we don&apos;t need.
var url = resource.Replace
    (&quot;TopLevelNamespace.web.&quot;, &quot;&quot;);

// Function I made that turns the 
// resource into a textStream
var r = LoadResource(url);

// Make the namespace look like a path
url = url.Replace(&quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;);
var lastSlash = url.LastIndexOf(&quot;/&quot;, 
    StringComparison.Ordinal);
url = url.Substring(0, lastSlash) + &quot;.&quot; \+ 
    url.Substring(lastSlash + 1);

// Register the response with the URL
factory.RegisterHandler(&quot;http://local/&quot; \+ url, 
    ResourceHandler.FromStream(r));
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>Now that I’ve explained all of the code.  The full class for loading the resources looks like this:</p>
<p>class RegisterWebsite<br>{<br>    public static void Load(ChromiumWebBrowser browser)<br>    {<br>        var factory = (DefaultResourceHandlerFactory)<br>            (browser.ResourceHandlerFactory);<br>        if (factory == null) return;<br>        var response = ResourceHandler<br>            .FromStream(LoadResource(“index.html”));<br>        factory.RegisterHandler(“<a href="http://local/&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://local/&quot;</a>, response);</p>
<pre><code>    var resourceNames = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()
        .GetManifestResourceNames();
    foreach (var resource in resourceNames)
    {
        if (!resource.StartsWith(&quot;TopLevelNamespace.web&quot;))
            continue;
        var url = resource.Replace(&quot;TopLevelNamespace.web.&quot;, &quot;&quot;);
        var r = LoadResource(url);
        url = url.Replace(&quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;);
        var lastSlash = url.LastIndexOf(&quot;/&quot;, 
            StringComparison.Ordinal);
        url = url.Substring(0, lastSlash) + &quot;.&quot; \+ 
            url.Substring(lastSlash + 1);
        factory.RegisterHandler(&quot;http://local/&quot; \+ url,
             ResourceHandler.FromStream(r));
    }
}

static Stream LoadResource(string filename)
{
    var assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
    var textStream = assembly
        .GetManifestResourceStream(&quot;TopLevelNamespace.&quot; 
            \+ filename);
    return textStream;
}
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>There is some obvious room for improvement here.  But the basics are there, you can tweak as needed. The main entry point is the Load method where we pass in a pointer to the browser control we created when we started this project.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-JavaScript-to-talk-to-C"><a href="#Getting-JavaScript-to-talk-to-C" class="headerlink" title="Getting JavaScript to talk to C#"></a>Getting JavaScript to talk to C#</h2><p>Now that we have the basics out of the way, we need to get the two halves of our project talking to each other.  The first half is that we need a way for our JavaScript client side code to retrieve data and send notifications to our server side code.  Fortunately, the mechanisms for doing this are already built into Chromium. Any C# object can be registered with Chromium as a JavaScript object so that any property will become a JavaScript field and any method will become a JavaScript method. The API to make this happen looks like this:</p>
<p>_browser<br>    .RegisterJsObject(“NameYouWantJavaScriptToSeeThisObjectAs”,<br>        cSharpObjectHere);</p>
<p>In our JavaScript code, we would find that the window object now has a field named “NameYouWantJavaScriptToSeeThisObjectAs”</p>
<h2 id="Getting-C-to-talk-to-C"><a href="#Getting-C-to-talk-to-C" class="headerlink" title="Getting C# to talk to C#"></a>Getting C# to talk to C#</h2><p>The reverse is just as easy. _browser.ExecuteScriptAsync(string) takes a string that is the JavaScript that you want to execute.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-the-Communication-To-Play-Nice-with-Angular"><a href="#Getting-the-Communication-To-Play-Nice-with-Angular" class="headerlink" title="Getting the Communication To Play Nice with Angular"></a>Getting the Communication To Play Nice with Angular</h2><p>But getting this all to play well with <a href="//angularjs.org/">Angular</a> requires just a little bit more. You may find that code on your screen that depends on a field or method that was registered with RegisterJsObject does not update when it should.  In fact, I would guess that this would happen most of the time because our C# object knows nothing of Angular and Angular knows nothing of our C# object.  So to fix this, we will need to make sure we $watch our C# object in our angular code.</p>
<p>$scope.$watch(function()<br>    {return window.RegisteredObject.property},<br>    function(){<br>    $scope.someField = window.RegisteredObject.property;<br>});</p>
<p>What this code does is that it tells Angular to check this field when it goes through its $digest cycle.  If it has changed since the last time it looked, it should run the second function that was passed in to $watch(). But this isn’t the only code you will need to add.  Whenever you make a change to something on the C# side that the Angular code needs to reflect, you’ll need to tell Angular to run the $digest() cycle manually.  To do that, you’ll use that ExecuteScriptAsync() method to run some JavaScript. The easiest way to do this is to just run it off the top level $scope object.  The way you find the top level $scope object is to use JavaScript to find the element that you marked as “ng-app” in your HTML.  Once you’ve done that, you will see that it has a scope() method hanging off of it.  So this code will force a $digest cycle on everything from the top level $scope all of the way down.</p>
<p>_browser<br>    .ExecuteScriptAsync(“angular.element(‘[ng-app]‘).scope().$digest();”);</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could skip setting the watch and have your ExecuteScriptAsync call set the $scope variables directly using something like this:</p>
<p>_browser.ExecuteScriptAsync(<br>“angular.element(‘#IdOfViewThatHasAControllerAttached’).”+<br>“scope().status = ‘this is a new status’;angular.” +<br>“element(‘[ng-app]‘).scope().$digest();”);</p>
<p>Where #IdOfViewThatHasAControllerAttached is an ID of a element in a view that you’ve associated with a controller.  You’ll still want your controller to pull from the C# JavaScript object for the initial load because the DIV may or may not be there when you do the push.  Personally, I prefer the $watch method.  There is less to think about on the C# side. And that’s how you create a desktop application using Angular, Bootstrap and C#.</p>

        <p>In my recent discussions with hiring managers about how hard it is to find good developers, the realization has slowly dawned on me that the programming language to learn today is JavaScript.  This is particularly true if you are a web developer, but I would be inclined to just make a blanket statement.  If you are a programmer, you should learn JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a><img src="/uploads/2015/10/image.png" alt="image" title="image"></h2><h2 id="Demand"><a href="#Demand" class="headerlink" title="Demand"></a>Demand</h2><p>The main reason that I say this, is that as JavaScript matures and things like Node.js become increasingly viable options, the demand for JavaScript programmers will continue to increase.  <a href="//www.codingdojo.com/blog/8-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2015/">JavaScript already surpasses C#</a> as rated by demand, and is surpassed only by Java.  And if you were to take a look at projects available to GitHub, you would find that <a href="//github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github">JavaScript has a growing representation</a> that surpasses previous kingpins including Java and C#.  And finally, looking at the <a href="//redmonk.com/sogrady/2014/01/22/language-rankings-1-14/">representation on StackOverflow</a>, we can see that JavaScript is in the top tier there as well.</p>
<h2 id="Better-Pay"><a href="#Better-Pay" class="headerlink" title="Better Pay"></a>Better Pay</h2><p>According to SitePoint, <a href="//www.sitepoint.com/best-programming-language-learn-2015-job-demand-salaries/">JavaScript pays better than C#</a>.  Again, Java pays a bit better right now.  But as demand for JavaScript grows, you can expect the pay to increase as well. On Gooroo, <a href="//gooroo.io/GoorooTHINK/Article/16300/Programming-languages--salaries-and-demand-May-2015/18672#.VhARuXpVhBc">the pay vs demand shows a little different picture</a>.  While the demand for JavaScript is evident, it is obvious that several languages that have a smaller demand actually pay better.  I suspect this is because many organizations still think of JavaScript as the language that anyone can use.  It will be a very painful lesson when they find out that “Anyone can program in JavaScript” really means, “Anyone can write crappy code in JavaScript”.  Which is where you and I step in to clean up the mess that was left behind. Over on StackOverflow, we see a <a href="//stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015">very detailed breakdown of developers for the last three years</a>.  When you finally get down to the “Technologies Used” section what we find is that if you just call yourself a JavaScript programmer (I’m assuming client side here) you get paid better than Java and less than C# but if you say you are a Node.js programmer (which is all JavaScript) you are the second highest paid skill.  The only thing that pays better is Objective-C (and I’m assuming soon, Swift).</p>
<h2 id="JavaScript-is-Maturing"><a href="#JavaScript-is-Maturing" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript is Maturing"></a>JavaScript is Maturing</h2><p>With the recent commitment of the standards committee to release a new JavaScript standard every year, it is clear that the amount of Syntactic Sugar that will be added on to JavaScript is going to be increasing every year for a while now.  One of the features I’m looking forward to is the ability to use the async and await keywords in my JavaScript code to eliminate callback hell. But, the reason this matters to you is that the sooner you start learning JavaScript, the easier it will be to learn.  All of the changes that happen after you learn it will all be incremental.  The browsers are also continually improving how they handle JavaScript code.  I can see a time in the future when browsers not only cache the JavaScript files, but cache the compiled version of the JavaScript files.  Bringing us closer to near binary speed. It is interesting to me that several years ago, people were debating the future of JavaScript and now, there is active work being done to make JavaScript a first class language.</p>
<h2 id="Some-JavaScript-Programmers-Are-More-Equal-Than-Others"><a href="#Some-JavaScript-Programmers-Are-More-Equal-Than-Others" class="headerlink" title="Some JavaScript Programmers Are More Equal Than Others"></a>Some JavaScript Programmers Are More Equal Than Others</h2><p>I was talking with an old friend about a year ago.  He mentioned that he was the only one in his group of about 20 programmers who wrote JavaScript in such a way as to eliminate polluting the global scope with variables.  That is just the most simple of examples.  Many people who call themselves <a href="/7-javascript-interview-questions-to-weed-out-imposters/">JavaScript programmers, don’t know the basics</a>.  And that is today.  Imagine what this is going to look like three to five years from now. And don’t forget that a lot of the tooling to support profiling and memory leaks is just at its infancy.  If you have those skills today, and you have marketed yourself well, you are already realizing that a lot of what I’m saying here is true. If you are interested in this kind of stuff, there are some courses over on PluralSight.  Just search for “<a href="/pluralsightJSProfiling">JavaScript profiling</a>”</p>
<h2 id="Frameworks-Are-Maturing"><a href="#Frameworks-Are-Maturing" class="headerlink" title="Frameworks Are Maturing"></a>Frameworks Are Maturing</h2><p>With the new version of Angular in the works, Aurelia in the works as an alternative.  Commercial products such as Scencha’s EXTjs.  Node.js for server side programing.  And others…  No one can say that it is too hard to develop real applications using JavaScript.  I’m pretty sure, if I wanted to, I could write a desktop application that ran using nothing but JavaScript.  Oh.  Wait.  That’s already been done.  (Visual Studio Code for those of you who were asleep for that announcement.) Actually, since I’ve written that last paragraph I’ve started writing a desktop application that uses HTML with Bootstrap and Angular for the presentation layer and C# for mostly data access.  Yes, I know I could do the whole thing in JavaScript if I wanted to, but I’m going with what is most familiar right now.  Apologies to XAML fans.</p>
<h2 id="JavaScript-Runs-Everywhere"><a href="#JavaScript-Runs-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript Runs Everywhere"></a>JavaScript Runs Everywhere</h2><p>JavaScript runs on every major browser on every major platform.  It runs on the server side on every major operating system.  Anyone writing a web site today of any major functionality is going to need someone who knows JavaScript to write the front end.  It doesn’t matter what the back end code was written in be it Java, PHP, .NET, Node.js or something else, the client side is going to need a JavaScript developer.  In fact, I still run into pockets of developers who just don’t know how powerful JavaScript is.  What this means for you is this.  If you become an awesome JavaScript programmer, you will have jobs available to you across all of the various server side platforms.  It will help if you learn a little bit about those platforms.  But I’m talking about niching down in JavaScript so that you become THE go to person.</p>
<h2 id="JavaScript-is-a-Compiled-Language"><a href="#JavaScript-is-a-Compiled-Language" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript is a Compiled Language"></a>JavaScript is a Compiled Language</h2><p>It may shock you to know that, technically, JavaScript is a compiled language.  This has two implications.  First, once the code is compiled, it is possible for it to run as fast as any other executable.  Second, it is technically possible to write tooling for JavaScript that would create a binary file that does not need to be recompiled every time the code is loaded into memory.</p>
<h2 id="What-Do-You-Think"><a href="#What-Do-You-Think" class="headerlink" title="What Do You Think?"></a>What Do You Think?</h2><p>Of course this is all totally opinion.  What do you think?  Leave me a comment.</p>

        <p>I’ve been using the CefSharp.Offscreen library to drive the Chromium browser for a couple of months now.  While the code I’ve been working on has been working correctly, I could never figure out why so many instances of Chromium are left dangling in my task manager.  Oh, they’d all go away once I exited the application, but then it would take a very long time for my application to completely close because there were so many instances of Chromium hanging around. This past week, I finally figured out how to keep the number of Chromium instances in line with the number of off-screen browser windows I was actually creating. <img src="/uploads/2015/09/image4.png" alt="image" title="image"> I’m using version 41 of CefSharp, any future problem may not have this problem.  This post is intended to walk through the discovery steps and is not meant as a ding on the CefSharp developers.  Hey!  For all I know, the problem is in Chromium. So, as I’ve already mentioned, I noticed many instances of Chromium in my task manager.  At first I thought this was normal.  I’ve seen many instances of the Chrome browser in my task manager even though I only had one browser window open.  And I’ve seen information on the web that says multiple windows are needed to make Chromium work. But the more I run my program, the more windows show up in task manager.  Certainly this isn’t right. And then I started thinking about my code.  Every instance of my browser is wrapped in a using statement because the browser windows is disposable.  Could it be possible that some resource isn’t being disposed correctly as we use the same browser window to navigate from one page to another? Here is some code to illustrate my point.</p>
<p>// One browser window open at this point<br>// because of init code that runs before.<br>using(var browser = new BrowserObject())<br>{<br>    foreach(var item in listOfItems)<br>    {<br>       browser.LoadUrl(someNewLocation);<br>    }<br>}<br>// Multiple browser windows open here</p>
<p>So, obviously this isn’t right.  Well, at least it is obvious to me. But what if the use case for this never was intended for it to be used like a regular window.  In that case, putting the using statement inside of the foreach would solve my problem.  It isn’t quite as efficient as I would like, but at least it would work.  And the fact that I had so many instances of chromium running was eating up memory and slowing my whole computer down.  At least this would give me my computer back. So, I changed the code to look more like this:</p>
<p>// One browser window open at this point<br>// because of init code that runs before.<br>foreach(var item in listOfItems)<br>{<br>    using(var browser = new BrowserObject())<br>    {<br>       browser.LoadUrl(someNewLocation);<br>    }<br>}<br>// One browser window open here.</p>
<p>Fixed!</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’ve been looking at Angular.js recently.  I’ve already got enough of a project done in <a href="//www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> (with <a href="//mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a>), <a href="//expressjs.com/">Express</a>, <a href="//angularjs.org/">Angular</a> and <a href="//nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> (MEAN) to be comfortable with how Angular works.  But I wanted to give it a try using ASP.NET as the back end.  I’m always learning.  Always improving. To start out, I just setup an index.html page to hold my basic form as I got the basic look and feel going.  But as I progressed, I wanted to make sure I progressed, I wanted to add in the capability of using Angular’s html5mode for the client side routing. For those of you who are new to Angular, Angular is a client side JavaScript framework that will allow you to create web applications where much of the processing happens on the client side instead of the server side.  That’s cool enough.  But it also adds the ability to handle client side routing, just like ASP.NET’s MVC handles server side routing.  This allows you to have a client side “master page” that can suck in the differences from the server as it needs them based on the url that is in the address bar.  In fact, there is an extension that will let you have sub routes as far down as you need. Out of the box, Angular, and most other frameworks that implement client side routing, using the hash symbol to specify the route.  For example</p>
<p>http:/index.html#/pathToRoute</p>
<p>This allows the routing to work on older browsers. ASP.NET, Angular.js &amp; html5mode <img src="/uploads/2015/09/image3.png" alt="image" title="image"> ASP.NET, Angular.js &amp; html5modeBut if you are working with newer browsers that support HTML5, you can avoid the hash tag and just create a route that looks like this:</p>
<p>http:/pathToRoute</p>
<p>Which you have to admit, looks a whole lot nicer. But here  is where the problems start. As soon as you implement html5mode on a site that is hosted in IIS or IIS express, you will get a 404 error because your initial request to the server is going to ask the server for a path that doesn’t exist. There are a few ways that you can take care of this.</p>
<h2 id="Return-a-default-view-for-every-undefined-server-route"><a href="#Return-a-default-view-for-every-undefined-server-route" class="headerlink" title="Return a default view for every undefined server route."></a>Return a default view for every undefined server route.</h2><p>One of the first suggestions you are likely to find suggest creating a default view for all routes that start with “/angular/”. This is a great start.  But here are my issues with it.  If I really want to use Angular the way it was intended to be used, I would prefer to not have to use MVC on the server side at all.  While not a huge hit, writing a razor page just to get my initial angular page up seems to be a bit of overkill.  There must be a way to do this without creating a *.chshtml file.  I also don’t want to have a sub directory for my page.  Why can’t I just go to <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com">http://blog.dmbcllc.com</a> as my default route?  And why can’t I just return a plain old html file?! Well, it turns out you can.  A slight modification of the “Return a default view” method is to have your controller return your html page.</p>
<h2 id="Return-an-HTML-page-direct-from-the-controller"><a href="#Return-an-HTML-page-direct-from-the-controller" class="headerlink" title="Return an HTML page direct from the controller."></a>Return an HTML page direct from the controller.</h2><p>If you dig a bit further, you’ll find that someone else has realized that you can just return your HTML directly from the controller.  The magic to this trick is all similar to what the guy in the original article did except for in the controller, instead of returning the view, he returns the html file that contains the main html.</p>
<p>public ActionResult Index()<br>{<br>    return File(“~/yourstartpage.html”, “text/html”);<br>}</p>
<p>And his main MVC route looks like this:</p>
<p>routes.MapRoute(<br>      name: “Default”,<br>      url: “{*.}”,<br>      defaults: new<br>      {<br>        controller = “Home”,<br>        action = “Index”,<br>      }<br>  );</p>
<p>This implementation has the added benefit that I’m not tied to a specific sub directory because it just says, “Any URL that doesn’t have a real file behind it should resolve to this default route.” Of course, you may be thinking, but what about the WEB API route, or any other routes I want in my system.  Well, just make sure this route comes first and you have other routes to cover the real routes you want to be able to support. Now, this gets past the objection I had with the first solution.  I no longer have to have a route.  But, why should I need to call the controller?  This is just a static HTML file we are talking about.  I should be able to by pass ASP.NET handling this file and just have IIS serve it up directly to me.</p>
<h2 id="Use-the-URL-Rewrite-Module"><a href="#Use-the-URL-Rewrite-Module" class="headerlink" title="Use the URL Rewrite Module"></a>Use the URL Rewrite Module</h2><p>A little deeper digging on the search engines reminded me that  I could just setup the <a href="//www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite">URL Rewrite module</a> to return my main HTML page when no real page is available.  BTW, URL Rewrite is built into IIS Express, so it should work in your development environment if you are using IIS Express as well as under IIS with the module installed. The main step to getting this working is to add the following XML to your Web.config file:</p>
<p>&lt;system.webServer&gt;<br>    <rewrite><br>        <rules><br>            <rule name="angularjs routes" stopprocessing="true"><br>                <match url=".*"><br>                <conditions logicalgrouping="MatchAll"><br>                    <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchtype="IsFile" negate="true"><br>                    <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchtype="IsDirectory" negate="true"><br>                    <add input="{REQUEST_URI}" pattern="^/(api)" negate="true"><br>                </add></add></add></conditions><br>                <action type="Rewrite" url="/"><br>            </action></match></rule><br>        </rules><br>    </rewrite><br>&lt;/system.webServer&gt;</p>
<p>You should already have a system.webServer section in your web.config file, so you just need the rewrite rule inside of it. Basically what this rule does is that it says, “If you can’t find the file, and the path you are looking for is not a subdirectory of the “api” directory, return the default file at the root.”  The part about the API directory allows your WEB API stuff to continue working. The only other thing you will need to do, which isn’t unique to ASP.NET or MVC, is that you will need to remember to add the base tag to the HEAD section of your HTML file.</p>
<base href="/">

<p>And all of your client side routing with HTML5 issues should be solved. Notice that no ASP.NET code has to run to get this working.  In fact, the only time you’ll need to run ASP.NET is to call the server for data.</p>

        <p>Recently someone asked me where the business rules should go in an MVC framework.  The Model or the Controller? This reminded me of a post I wrote when ASP.NET MVC was first released.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/aspnet-mvc-model-bll-or-dal/">ASP.NET MVC – Model != BLL or DAL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But today I want to cover a broader topic common to everyone, not just programmers.  Not being able to think outside the box. <img src="/uploads/2015/09/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Here’s-the-deal"><a href="#Here’s-the-deal" class="headerlink" title="Here’s the deal."></a>Here’s the deal.</h2><p>Good salesmen have known for years that the best way to close the sale is to ask the customer to pick between two buying decisions.  You never ask, “So, did you want to buy that today?”  Because almost invariably the customer will say, “No” because the implication is, “Did you want to buy that today, or some other day?”  And “some other day” is always a better option to the customer.  No, the proper way to frame the question is, “So, how did you want to pay for that?  Cash or Credit?” or “Did you want the blue one or the green one?”  By doing this, the customer is no longer even thinking “later” is an option.  The only options he is thinking about are the options he’s been presented with.  This isn’t to say that there isn’t a customer who can fight past this and respond, “No, I was just looking today.”  But the chance of the customer leaving without buying have just been reduced dramatically because two buying choices have been presented. So, what does this have to do with programming?  Well, that’s exactly what happens when we’ve been given an architectural framework to program with. Someone shows you the MVC pattern and you immediately think that the only places code can live in our application are in the Model, the View, or the Controller. Someone shows you the MVP pattern and you think code can only live in the Model, the View or the Presenter. Someone shows you the MVVM pattern and we think code only lives in the Model, the View or the ViewModel. And so, I ask you. Given any of those three patterns, where do you put your business logic?  And while we are at it, where does your data access logic go?</p>
<h2 id="Do-we-place-it-in-the-model"><a href="#Do-we-place-it-in-the-model" class="headerlink" title="Do we place it in the model?"></a>Do we place it in the model?</h2><p>Well, what is the model for?  A model is for storing data.  For most of us the data is a record that is displayed on the screen as a series of fields.  But how it gets displayed and what it actually contains doesn’t matter as much as the fact that the model <strong>stores data</strong>.  Nothing there even hints at executing code.  In fact, I would argue that for most of our applications, the model should be so simple that it doesn’t need to be tested.</p>
<h2 id="How-about-the-Controller-or-the-Presenter"><a href="#How-about-the-Controller-or-the-Presenter" class="headerlink" title="How about the Controller or the Presenter?"></a>How about the Controller or the Presenter?</h2><p>A controller or presenter sends commands to the model to change its state and sends commands to the view to update the presentation.  Here things get a little confusing.  It sounds like, because the controller is sending commands the the model and the view that it is where the business rules live. In fact, when I was first introduced to MVC, this is what I thought was true.  But notice there is nothing in the statement about what a controller does that would indicate that it is anything more than a traffic cop.</p>
<h2 id="View-Model"><a href="#View-Model" class="headerlink" title="View Model?"></a>View Model?</h2><p>In the MVVM pattern, it becomes even clearer that there is no clear place for business logic because the ViewModel holds the state of the view.  The presenter or controller part is handled by a binder that is typically part of the framework you are using, as with KnockOut.</p>
<h2 id="Thinking-outside-the-box"><a href="#Thinking-outside-the-box" class="headerlink" title="Thinking outside the box"></a>Thinking outside the box</h2><p>Now that we’ve demonstrated that none of these frameworks explicitly state where the business logic should go, where should we put it? In my case, what I’ve started doing is that I’ve created a service layer, or a business rules layer.  It handles the processing of the logic to get the rest of the code working.  The classes in this layer can either be passed the model or viewmodel in which they can change the state directly, or they can return data that the controller can distribute as needed.  In my most recent application I selected the pass the model in approach.  The result was code that was much more testable than what I had started with, which is the whole point of placing the business rules outside of the pattern to begin with.  </p>

        <p>I’ve noticed a trend recently.  Someone will write a post about some technical interview question and someone will write a comment about how that’s such a dumb question that they wouldn’t even bother answering it.  I’ve actually been that guy recently.  John Sonmez wrote about “<a href="//simpleprogrammer.com/2015/01/19/cracking-the-coding-interview/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>” and I responded that I don’t do coding interviews.  <a href="/cracking-the-programmers-interview-code/">In fact, I wrote a whole post about this</a>.  But as John pointed out, this may actually cause you to be limiting your career.  You wouldn’t answer that question for a 33% raise?  Really?  There isn’t anything that could motivate you to consider answering a question that you feel is useless, stupid or dumb? This week, I saw another post about some technical interview question that someone said he wouldn’t answer.  Sorry, I don’t have a link for that one, I wish I did. And then add to this, the number of useless interview questions I have answered in the last year.  Why did I answer them?  Because I could.  Because the challenge was actually fun. And so, let’s reconsider the arrogant stance of “Thanks for your time, I’ll show myself out.” First let’s consider why we might not want to answer a particular question. <img src="/uploads/2015/09/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Telling-The-Truth-Makes-You-Happier"><a href="#Telling-The-Truth-Makes-You-Happier" class="headerlink" title="Telling The Truth Makes You Happier."></a>Telling The Truth Makes You Happier.</h2><p>As I said, I’ve answered a lot of useless questions.  Most recently, I was asked about how garbage collection works in .NET.  When is the last time anyone needed to know that?  Isn’t the whole point of .NET that memory management gets handled for you?  Someone else may have refused to answer the question.  Why?  Because we don’t think we can. The reason I don’t like code interviews is because 1) I’ve never had to do one and 2) I’m afraid I won’t be able to do it. Dumb reason! The post I mentioned earlier that I don’t have a link for was something about how linked lists worked.  Or sorting.  Why did he consider it an issue?  Maybe because he didn’t feel like he could answer it? Let’s face it, most of use, rather than admitting we don’t know something, would just rather deflect the problem to the person asking the question. And so, the first way that just answering the question will make you happier is that telling the truth makes you happier. The more honest we are with ourselves and with others, <a href="//www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life/time-to-come-clean-little-white-lies-found-to-be-a-health-hazard-20120805-23o0t.html">the happier we are</a>. So, rather than taking the stance of “I won’t answer that question”, why not prepare yourself so that you CAN answer the question? And this leads to my second reason…</p>
<h2 id="You-Will-Gain-Confidence"><a href="#You-Will-Gain-Confidence" class="headerlink" title="You Will Gain Confidence"></a>You Will Gain Confidence</h2><p>How’s that?  Well, let’s say you answer the question, the first time, the best way that you know how but you know you were pretty shaky.  So, you go home, and look up the answer.  The next time you get asked the question, you are better prepared.  You’ve learned something along the way and are now more confident.  Or, you may find out that the question wasn’t all that important given all you were able to answer. I’ll tell you a little insider secret.  If you really know your stuff, you’ll probably get the job anyhow.  The interviewer is just trying to figure out how much you know.  If you’ve gotten to the point where they are asking one of these seemingly irrelevant questions, you’ve probably already got the job. Most people can’t even answer the basic questions I’ve previously blogged about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/7-c-interview-questions-that-weed-out-the-losers/">Basic C# Questions</a></li>
<li><a href="/7-javascript-interview-questions-to-weed-out-imposters/">Basic JavaScript Questions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I know of at least two places that have interviewed 10 people just to find one that would be OK.  Knowing this, alone, has given me a lot more confidence when I interview. But as people have mentioned on those post, just because they can answer the questions, doesn’t mean they can code.  We have to have other questions we can ask you to get at that. I’ve been in two interviews, that I can remember that did this well.  One was for a position that was mostly JavaScript.  In fact, he never asked me anything about C#.  What he said was something like, “I know nothing about JavaScript, tell me about JavaScript.”  And then he stopped talking and listened to me.  Every once in a while he would say, “Tell me more about that.”  That was the entire interview. A couple of weeks ago, I was asked to talk about my experience with ASP.NET’s MVC. A question that was just as open ended.  The guy’s boss, who was the hiring manager, questioned the open endedness of the question.  The response was, “I want to know if he’s worked with it before.  If he has, he should be able to answer that question.” Interestingly, there were no JavaScript questions this time.</p>
<h2 id="You-Might-Get-Your-Dream-Job"><a href="#You-Might-Get-Your-Dream-Job" class="headerlink" title="You Might Get Your Dream Job"></a>You Might Get Your Dream Job</h2><p>Listen!  You decided to interview, I assume, because you wanted this job, or at least thought you might want this job.  You’re going to walk out of an interview and make yourself look like an ass simply because you don’t like the question?  Who is being dumb now?! Like I said, it is so hard to find good talent, that if they are asking hard questions, you’ve probably already got the job anyhow.  But if you walk out, not only do you not have the job, but you’ll never get a second chance to interview with the people in the room again, and that includes when they show up at other companies.  Think that’s not true?  I know I keep a mental list of people I might want to consider in the future.  Both people I’ve worked with and people I’ve interviewed. So take your best stab at the question.  There have been a number of times when my answer has been, I don’t know, but here is how I’d find out when I needed it.  Often the “how I’d get the information answer” is better than actually being able to answer the question. So, dare to answer the questions.  The results might surprise you.    </p>
