    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>My son is learning to program.  Last week he asked me to explain C# properties get and set and, as it turns out, it looks like many others are asking for the same.  So, I’ve decided to spend the time on this post, explaining getters and setters in about as much detail as one can expect. So here it goes…</p>
<h2 id="Member-Variables"><a href="#Member-Variables" class="headerlink" title="Member Variables"></a>Member Variables</h2><p>So, a class has “member variables” that are typically scoped as private, although they could be (but shouldn’t be) scoped as public.</p>
<p>class SomeClass<br>{<br>    private int _someMemberIntegerVariable;<br>}</p>
<p>Inside the class definition but not in the methods.  You’ll also sometimes see this referred to as a “field”.  I call them “member variables” because that is what I learned them as back when I was programming C++.</p>
<h2 id="Local-Variables"><a href="#Local-Variables" class="headerlink" title="Local Variables"></a>Local Variables</h2><p>If the variable is in a method, it is called a “local variable”</p>
<p>class SomeClass<br>{<br>    public void SomeMethod()<br>    {<br>        int someLocalIntegerVariable;<br>    }<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Class-“State”"><a href="#Class-“State”" class="headerlink" title="Class “State”"></a>Class “State”</h2><p>Now, the reason we have member variables is because they hold the “state” of the object.  For example, you might have a person class (typical example).  The Person class would have a firstName, lastName, birthDate as member variables so that when the class is created (and becomes an object) they can hold the state of the person. “Dave”, “Bush”, 6/20/61.</p>
<p>class Person<br>{<br>    private string _firstName;<br>    private string _lastName;<br>    private Date _birthDate;<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Old-Time-Get-and-Set"><a href="#Old-Time-Get-and-Set" class="headerlink" title="Old Time Get and Set"></a>Old Time Get and Set</h2><p>Now, in the old days (my C++ days) we’d just make those member variables public so that any other class could access them directly.  The problem with that is that any other class could access them directly leaving our class unable to control what exactly came into them.  And so, some gatekeeping was added.  In C++ and Java, that was done with setter methods and getter methods.  In Java that may have changed since the days I programmed in Java, but they started that way at least. That is, setFirstName(string name), setLastName(string name), setBirthDay(date birthday)</p>
<p>class Person<br>{<br>    private string _firstName;<br>    private string _lastName;<br>    private Date _birthDate;</p>
<pre><code>public setFirstName(firstName)
{
    _firstName = firstName;
}
public setLastName(lastName)
{
    _lastName = lastName;
}
public setFirstName(Date birthDate)
{
    _birthDate = birthDate;
}
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>  and to retrieve them…. getFirstName(), getLastName(), getBirthDate() the setters and getters are public (or protected, or private as needed) but the member variables are always private so that only the class they are declared in can access them. Inside the setter, we make sure the data is valid before we set the member variable, or possibly do some sort of computation before we store it, or even pass it on to some other location. But as far as anyone using the class is concerned, it is set setting a value and when it calls the getter, it retrieves the value, or something similar.</p>
<h2 id="C-Properties-Get-and-Set"><a href="#C-Properties-Get-and-Set" class="headerlink" title="C# Properties - Get and Set"></a>C# Properties - Get and Set</h2><p>So along comes C# and that language says, “having a getter method and a setter method is pretty dumb, we should syntactically stich them together.” And so they came up with properties The syntax for that is</p>
<p>private datatype _propertyName;<br>public datatype PropertyName<br>{<br>    get {return _propertyName;}<br>    set{_propertyName = value;}<br>}</p>
<p>Which is all declared inside a class.  The member variable doesn’t have to be named the same as the property, but it often is .  It is customary to name member variables with a leading underscore.  Local variables start with a lowercase character. So, properties and member variables are distinct. Although, you may have thought they were essentially the same thing. At the end of the day, once they are compiled, properties are just methods. But syntactically, you access them as though they were variables.  In fact, if you looked at a property in Intermediate Language (IL), the language that all .NET code compiles to, you would see that it is just a method. To access a property from within your code, you would access it as</p>
<p>someObject.FirstName = “Dave”;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>someVariable = someObject.FirstName;</p>
<p>the only reason they exist at all is to keep the outside world (outside the class) from stomping on the member variables of the class directly. The compiler does for us what the old timers did (and the Java guys still do) using getMethod and setMethod So, as it turns out, we need all that gatekeeping, but the fact of the matter is, many times we don’t. When I was teaching, I’d have guys say, “if I don’t need the gatekeeper, why even bother with the properties?” Which is kind of a valid point But I always countered, “But what if you eventually do?</p>
<h2 id="Enhanced-Properties"><a href="#Enhanced-Properties" class="headerlink" title="Enhanced Properties"></a>Enhanced Properties</h2><p>I think Microsoft heard that so they embellished the language so that we don’t have to declare the member variable if all we are going to do is just pass the data on through to it. That syntax is</p>
<p>public dataType PropertyName {get;set;}</p>
<p>the compiler generates the member variable for you So if I wanted to actually do something with the member variable, you would need to declare the member variable. It depends on what you were going to do with it. If you just wanted to retrieve the data at some other point in your application, you’d just use the property.  But if you needed to manipulate the data as it was being set or retrieved, you’d have to use the original syntax. And that’s properties up until today.</p>

        <p>loading…</p>
<p>This happened a couple of years ago, but it is still relevant because I know of at least one place where it is still happening even though Microsoft has fixed the issue that initially caused this hack to be put in place in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-In-Production-–-Oh-NO"><a href="#Problem-In-Production-–-Oh-NO" class="headerlink" title="Problem In Production – Oh NO!"></a>Problem In Production – Oh NO!</h2><p>Here’s the problem we were seeing.  We had several large PDF files that the client wanted to put up on the site so that their customers could download them.  The problem that we were seeing is that even though the site worked fine under development and QA, the site seemed to consume a lot of memory under load.</p>
<p>Another symptoms we saw was that the file download took a lot of time to start, or timed out completely.  But the main issue was the memory because when the memory was consumed, the site would restart, and because it was a worker process crash that caused it, the restart took the site down.  This is not something you want to see happen when you are working with a client with world wide exposure.  A client who, if I told you the name, I’m sure you would recognize.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the site not responding, or crashing, that first alerted us to the problem.  So, as soon as we knew the site wasn’t responding, I’d log onto the server and fire up task manager to see what was going on.</p>
<h2 id="Server-Management-Tip"><a href="#Server-Management-Tip" class="headerlink" title="Server Management Tip"></a>Server Management Tip</h2><p>One of the things I did early on managing the servers, is that I set up an entirely separate app pool for each of the web sites we are hosting.  This way, we can monitor the memory and CPU activity of each one independently.  For those of you who are interested, the way to make the pool name show up in task manager is to run the pool in ApplicationPoolIdentity, a setting you can get to through “Advanced Settings…”  If you are only hosting one site, you shouldn’t need to do this, but in my case, with multiple sites, this told me a lot about what was going on with the sites and ultimately helped me track down what the problem was.</p>
<p>By the way, you should always run each of your sites under a separate application pool so that when one site is having trouble, every site on your server doesn’t have trouble.  Imagine having an issue and not even knowing for sure which site was causing the trouble.  It’s bad enough not knowing what page is causing the problem.</p>
<h2 id="It-Is-a-Memory-Issue-Now-What"><a href="#It-Is-a-Memory-Issue-Now-What" class="headerlink" title="It Is a Memory Issue.  Now What?"></a>It Is a Memory Issue.  Now What?</h2><p>OK.  So, I could see the memory increasing as soon as the site came back up.  So, now to try to track down what was causing memory issues.</p>
<p>I tried various things along the way, none of them shed any light at all on the problem.  I even got dotMemory from JetBrains to see if I could find anything.  A memory leak maybe?  No, none of my code had even a small leak.</p>
<h2 id="The-Fix-Discovered"><a href="#The-Fix-Discovered" class="headerlink" title="The Fix Discovered"></a>The Fix Discovered</h2><p>And then I finally stumbled on the issue.  I can’t remember what it was that we installed that needed this, but what it did was change our web.config file so that it had a section in it that looks like this:</p>
<p><configuration><br>… lots of other configuration stuff …<br>  &lt;system.webServer&gt;<br>    &lt;modules <strong>runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests=”true”</strong>&gt;</configuration></p>
<p>What that causes IIS to do is to run ALL of your web request through ALL of your .NET modules.  Why is this a problem you ask?  Because it even runs all of your images, css, javascript and other static content.  This isn’t normally a huge problem because most of that stuff is relatively small. But, when you try to run a be PDF through that pipeline, you’ll run out of memory because, and this is the major issue here, because the whole file has to be loaded into memory on the server before it can be sent on to the web browser to download.</p>
<p>Make sure that runAllManagedModulesForAllRequest is either set to false, or doesn’t exist in your web.config file.  If you need it to be turned on for some valid reason that I am not thinking of, at least put your static files on another site where this can be turned off.</p>
<h2 id="Moral-Of-The-Story"><a href="#Moral-Of-The-Story" class="headerlink" title="Moral Of The Story"></a>Moral Of The Story</h2><p>Now, the question that we should be asking now that we’ve figured it all out is, why wasn’t this caught earlier?  When a site goes up, isn’t all of the functionality, including all of the links to all of the images, files to download, and other pages on the site and off the site supposed to be tested?</p>
<p>Yes, of course they are, but if you haven’t at least written down where all of this is, if you don’t have a systematic way of testing EVERYTHING, you WILL end up with these kind of errors once you put the site live.  This is to say nothing of load testing along the way.  This can all be prevented. .csharpcode, .csharpcode pre { font-size: small; color: black; font-family: consolas, “Courier New”, courier, monospace; background-color: #ffffff; /*white-space: pre;*/ } .csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; } .csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; } .csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; } .csharpcode .str { color: #006080; } .csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; } .csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; } .csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; } .csharpcode .html { color: #800000; } .csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; } .csharpcode .alt { background-color: #f4f4f4; width: 100%; margin: 0em; } .csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</p>

<p>This week I discovered CSS Animations.  Well, I shouldn’t say I discovered it so much as I finally spent some time figuring out what it is and why I would care about it.  This could make so much of what we normally do in JavaScript entirely unnecessary.  So, more for my own benefit than anything else, I thought today I would just create a list of resources that are available. But first, why would you want to use CSS for animation when JavaScript could do it just as well?</p>
<h2 id="CSS-and-HTML-live-in-the-same-world"><a href="#CSS-and-HTML-live-in-the-same-world" class="headerlink" title="CSS and HTML live in the same world"></a>CSS and HTML live in the same world</h2><p>As I mentioned a few weeks ago when I discussed JavaScript performance, anytime you manipulate the DOM from JavaScript, you have to cross the HTML/JavaScript boundary.  And to do it right, you have to make sure you work in sync with the key frames that the DOM is living in.  If you don’t, at best you will be animating more than you need to if you use JavaScript to do the animation.  On a phone, this can eat up precious battery life.  For me, this is the biggest reason.</p>
<h2 id="Declarative-Code-Is-Easier-To-Read"><a href="#Declarative-Code-Is-Easier-To-Read" class="headerlink" title="Declarative Code Is Easier To Read"></a>Declarative Code Is Easier To Read</h2><p>I realize that some may disagree with this.  But my feeling is, if I can express in one line what would  take a loop in JavaScript to do, I’ll take the one line of code.  This one of the things that makes Angular attractive.  I can create my own HTML tags.  Why not get the same benefit from my CSS?</p>
<h2 id="Reasons-Why-You-Might-Not"><a href="#Reasons-Why-You-Might-Not" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why You Might Not"></a>Reasons Why You Might Not</h2><p>There are a few reasons why you might not use CSS Animations.  First, it is relatively new.  It may not do everything you want it to do.  So, you may have to resort to using JavaScript for at least some of the things you want to do. Second, it may not support all of the browsers you need to support.</p>
<h2 id="Resources"><a href="#Resources" class="headerlink" title="Resources"></a>Resources</h2><p>Here are a brief list of resources that I found</p>

</ul>
<p>When I first suggested “CSS Animations” to a designer friend of mine, he reacted as though I was suggesting putting a flash animation on a web site.  Obviously, we wouldn’t want to do that. But we use animation is some pretty creative ways.  So the next time you reach for JavaScript to add some sort of animation to your web application, do a search for a CSS Animation instead.</p>

<p>I had an interesting puzzle to solve this week that I thought I would share with you in case someone else is looking for a similar solution. There was some code that I needed to test that ultimately called into the database. Since this is a UNIT test and all I was interested in testing was one specific function and the state of one specific field in another  object, I had neither the need, nor the desire, to let that call to the database happen.  Since MOQ is  my mocking framework of choice, I wanted to mock out the database object the method was using so that it would return whatever was expected without actually calling down into the database. There were several problems.  The first was that the database object is a private field in the class I was testing and it got created by the constructor.  Second, the code that needed to use the database object is passing the object by reference (using the “ref” keyword) so that I could no setup my class that needed that object to just ignore it. There were some other items I needed to inject, but they were pretty straight forward.</p>
<h2 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2><p>But first, I realize that some purist out there is going to leave me a comment that says you shouldn’t use a Dependency Injection container in your unit test.  My answer to that is, yes, ideally, one should not do this.  But, not everything is ideal.  Not every project is a “green field” project (and in fact about 95% of them aren’t).  And in some cases there is so much technical debt involved that the best we can do is a hack.  Read, <a href="//www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0131177052&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=davmbusnetapp-20&amp;linkId=2ULNYA2XTSEGDPLA">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davmbusnetapp-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0131177052" alt> for other illustrations of “hacks” to get code under test. So, there’s the problem.  It may not make a lot of sense yet, especially if you are not familiar with the tools.  So let’s walk through some code.</p>
<h2 id="The-Code"><a href="#The-Code" class="headerlink" title="The Code"></a>The Code</h2><p>The main method I wanted to test was hanging off a POCO class.  It is using what we call a “visitor” pattern (though I’m pretty sure this is not what the pattern is supposed to look like).  So we have an Accept() method hanging off of it that knows how to store the poco into the database. That method has a method it calls that hangs off a crud object called Create() that takes the POCO and a reference to the database. I want to mock the Create() method so that it never actually gets called.  The method should return the POCO as part of a list of the POCO’s type. Mocking out the crud object is pretty straight forward:</p>
<p>_mockCrud = new Mock<icrud>()</icrud></p>
<p>  and then registering it with the Unity DI container:</p>
<p>container.RegisterInstance(_mockCrud);</p>
<p>The real issue, and the main point of this post, is that when I wanted to call Create() what I needed to do was:</p>
<p>_mockCrud.Setup(<br>    x =&gt; x.Create(It.IsAny<ipocotype>(),<br>        ref It.IsAny<idatabasetype>())<br>    .Returns(pocoList);</idatabasetype></ipocotype></p>
<p>Which you can’t do. What you have to do instead is:</p>
<p>_mockCrud.Setup(<br>    x =&gt; x.Create(It.IsAny<ipocotype>(),<br>        ref _database))<br>    .Returns(pocoList);</ipocotype></p>
<p>And the only way this will work is if the _database variable is pointing to the same object that will ultimately get called. So, here is the magic that I used to make all that work. Reflection. The database object I needed was created as part of the constructor in yet another object that I pass into the Accept() method.  So, I create that object and then use reflection to get the instance of the database from it.</p>
<p>var visitor = new DataVisitor();<br>var fieldInfo = visitor.GetType()<br>    .GetField(“_database”,<br>        BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);<br>if(fieldInfo != null)<br>{<br>    _database = (Database)fieldInfo.GetValue(visitor);<br>}</p>
<p>And now I can use the Setup code I’ve already specified. Hope that helps someone else.</p>

<p>Whoa there Dave.  What are you talking about?  Have you given up the fight? You who have preached the TDD religion.  You who’ve struggled to get organizations to adopt naming conventions, to use version control systems and to use project management software.  The same guy who has implemented continuous integration on his current project?  What’s this world coming to?</p>
<p>No. Relax. I haven’t given up.  In fact it is precisely because technical debt is inevitable that we need to implement all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="Danger"><a href="#Danger" class="headerlink" title="Danger"></a>Danger</h2><p>But there  is a danger in believing that if we were to implement all of the best practices in the book, or that could ever be devised, that technical debt would simply vanish.  And the sooner some of you realize this, the less stressed out you will be.</p>
<p>You see, no matter how good of a programmer you are today, tomorrow you will be a better programmer.  That is true for all of us.  We are all doing as good of a job as we possibly can today.</p>
<h2 id="A-Story"><a href="#A-Story" class="headerlink" title="A Story"></a>A Story</h2><p>This reminds me of a story I heard once.</p>
<p>It seems there was this programmer who had to make a change to some code and, like we all do, the first thing he did was to try to wrap his head around the code he was looking at.  A few minutes into this common exercise, he starts exclaiming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who wrote this code?</li>
<li>This is the worst code I’ve ever seen.</li>
<li>The guy who wrote this can’t even really call himself a programmer!</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, it got unusually quite in his cubicle.</p>
<p>His friend in the next cube calls over the wall, “Hey John, you OK?”</p>
<p>And John responds, “It’s my code.”</p>
<p>Now, the reason this is a funny story… well, it is a funny story for me anyhow… is because this happens to us all of the time.</p>
<p>I think I spent the first 5 years of my career looking at code I wrote six months ago and thinking, “What was I thinking when I wrote this?”</p>
<p>Even today, 26 years in, I have code I wrote six months or more ago that I know I need to rewrite.  The only reason I haven’t yet is because I want to make sure I have a full test harness around it before I tweak it.</p>
<h2 id="Here’s-the-point"><a href="#Here’s-the-point" class="headerlink" title="Here’s the point."></a>Here’s the point.</h2><p>We are all getting better at what we do.  What we would do today isn’t what we would have done six months ago.  The person who wrote the code you are looking at was doing the best he could at the time.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should just plan on code being “wrong.”</p>
<p>This has two explicit implications to how you relate to your code and your co-workers.</p>
<h3 id="Don’t-be-surprised-by-bad-code"><a href="#Don’t-be-surprised-by-bad-code" class="headerlink" title="Don’t be surprised by bad code"></a>Don’t be surprised by bad code</h3><p>First, you should not be surprised when you find bad code.  You should instead be shocked when you find well written code.  Since even you write bad code, you should be gracious when you find bad code that isn’t yours.  You don’t want to be the guy in the story  I just told.  You might have done the same thing today if you knew only what the person who wrote the code you are looking at knew at the time the code was written.</p>
<h3 id="You-should-expect-that-your-code-will-be-broken-in-some-way"><a href="#You-should-expect-that-your-code-will-be-broken-in-some-way" class="headerlink" title="You should expect that your code will be broken in some way."></a>You should expect that your code will be broken in some way.</h3><p>This has been probably the hardest thing for me to get control of.  I have, historically, been one to deny that my code has a bug.  I’ve taken it as a personal insult, or an assault on my character when someone finds a bug in my code. </p>
<p>Until recently.</p>
<p>Once I was able to internalize the fact that the person reporting the bug was not upset, that the only person who expected me to be perfect was me, and that being wrong was part of being human, I was able to calm down a bit.</p>
<p>You see, none of us are all knowing.  Most of us program for what the code is supposed to do and don’t think about what it shouldn’t do (which is where most of the bugs occur).  The spoken/written language is an imprecise communicator, even if you develop a dictionary for your project.  You’ll never get all of your terms defined.  You just don’t know what you don’t know.  And therefore there will be bugs.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ll think, “I should have known that!”  Well, yes, maybe you SHOULD have.  But the fact is, you didn’t.</p>
<p>When before I used to deny that the bug could even exist, my reaction now is, “Hmmm, wonder what’s going on there.  OK, well, put it in the issue tracker and I’ll get it fixed.”</p>
<p>No drama.  No conflict.  No denial.  No blame.  Just deal with the issue.</p>
<h2 id="This-is-what-it-means-to-be-Agile"><a href="#This-is-what-it-means-to-be-Agile" class="headerlink" title="This is what it means to be Agile"></a>This is what it means to be Agile</h2><p>And you see, this is the beauty of the Agile methodology.  Agile assumes we aren’t going to get it right the first time.  It assumes humans are poor communicators.  It assumes that programmers aren’t going to understand the problem the first time they try to come up with a solution.  It assumes technical debt is inevitable.</p>
<p>Isn’t it time that you do too? Or am I the only one who has suffered with this problem?</p>

<p>As many of you know, I’ve been using <a href="//www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> to do my website testing.  And, if you’ve done any testing with Selenium yourself, you know that Selenium can be even slower if you are using Selenium Grid. There are several things you might do today to achieve Selenium Performance improvements in order to increase the speed that your of your test run.</p>
<h2 id="CacheLookup-attribute-or-Annotation-if-you-are-using-Java"><a href="#CacheLookup-attribute-or-Annotation-if-you-are-using-Java" class="headerlink" title="CacheLookup attribute (or Annotation if you are using Java)"></a>CacheLookup attribute (or Annotation if you are using Java)</h2><p>This is probably the most obvious place for improvement.  Assuming you are using the Page Model pattern in your testing, your page model should have properties that already look something like:</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using = “radioButton”)]<br>private IWebElement RadioButton{ get; set;};</p>
<p>What you may not know is that the way this works is that EVERY time you access the property named RadioButton it will lookup the location of the radio button.  The RadioButton property is actually a proxy for the real IWebElement that it will lookup on the fly. So, if you are using the element more than once in your test, it will perform the lookup each time you access the RadioButton property. By adding the CacheLookup attribute to the RadioButton property,</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using = “radioButton”), CacheLookup]<br>private IWebElement RadioButton{ get; set;};</p>
<p>you can force the RadioButton to be resolved once and only once. Most of my test ask for elements once per test, so I didn’t see any major performance gains by adding this.  Your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2 id="CacheLookup-Warning"><a href="#CacheLookup-Warning" class="headerlink" title="CacheLookup Warning"></a>CacheLookup Warning</h2><p>Be careful when adding CacheLookup to your properties because any time the HTML is recreated, the element will become “stale” and you’ll need to look it up again. For example, in one of the pages I’m testing, I have two modal windows that get created as part of the test.  Each time they are created, they have to be resolved again because the old ones no longer exist. It would be like trying to reference a pointer to an object that no longer exist because something else deleted it.  Actually, that’s exactly what is happening.</p>
<h2 id="CacheLookup-Only-Solves-One-of-Your-Problems"><a href="#CacheLookup-Only-Solves-One-of-Your-Problems" class="headerlink" title="CacheLookup Only Solves One of Your Problems"></a>CacheLookup Only Solves One of Your Problems</h2><p>But if all you do to your site is add CacheLookup, you are wasting your time.  You have to start thinking like your code. Did you know that every time you access a property on an IWebElement, Selenium has to make a call to the browser to access the current value? Yep. Actually, if you think about it, this is what you hope it does.  It is what makes code like this work:</p>
<p>Wait.Until(x =&gt; Page.RadioButton.GetAttrinbute(“disabled”));</p>
<p>But how many times to we write code that goes after a property multiple times when we know the value, or at least we assume the value, hasn’t changed? Or how many of you are doing the same thing multiple times in the same test? For example, in the code I’m testing currently, I have a header and a footer that I need to hide so that when an element is scrolled into view by Selenium, it doesn’t scroll under the header or the footer. I’m currently hiding and showing every time I perform some action on an element.  But now that I’m starting to think about performance, I’m asking myself, “What was I thinking?!” In this case, I would save a lot of time by turning the header off once a the beginning of my test.  I bet my test end up running twice as fast simply by doing that. So, keep in mind that every Selenium call you make is probably going to have to access the server in order to perform the action or retrieve the value you are looking for and try to write your code so that you are only making that call to the server one time per test. I bet you see some performance improvements.</p>

<p>I just finished listening to a <a href="//www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1033">DotNetRocks podcast today with Paul Sheriff</a> which largely talked about creating mobile web sites using ASP.NET WebForms.</p>
<p>During the show they discuss when you might use WebForms vs MVC and pointed out that WebForms still have their place, particularly in the corporate world, since they are just as testable as MVC and yet much easier to get something up and running quickly.  This is in contrast to a public facing site that might need to be as light weight as possible and therefore need the extra control that MVC can give you.</p>
<p>And then there is the issue of legacy code.  As they mentioned in the podcast, just because Microsoft has introduced a new technology, doesn’t mean we all have to go re-implement our websites in that technology the next day.  It doesn’t even mean we have to ever implement that technology.  It is just another option in our toolbox.  It is our job as developers and architects to know when the right time to use what technology is based on the requirements of the application and the skill set of our development team.</p>
<p><a href="/aspnet-mvc-is-the-grass-really-greener/">These are Points I’ve made in the past.</a></p>
<h2 id="The-War-Is-Over"><a href="#The-War-Is-Over" class="headerlink" title="The War Is Over"></a>The War Is Over</h2><p>The point I want to make today is this.  The war is over already.  I am surprised that this is still a conversation that the community is having.  Both sides have “lost” to a sneak attack by SPAs.  If this is still a conversation you think is worth having, I would suggest that you may be behind the learning curve.  The .NET world has moved on.</p>
<p>That is, client side models and frameworks have taken over.  What you use to produce the HTML that all lives in, is of very minor concern at best.</p>
<p>I suppose if you are interested in creating applications that are old style forms that post content to the server and refresh the page content or move on to another page, you might be interested in continuing to fight this war.  But in my world, most of the applications I work on could be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript calling back to a server that consumes and produces JSON.  In .NET, that would mean using WebAPI, which, while based on MVC, isn’t MVC.</p>
<h2 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h2><p>For some examples of this, check out the LabelsForEducation site which is a DotNetNuke site.  DotNetNuke is a CMS based on WebForms technology.  By using jQuery and knockout, I was able to create the interactive portions of the site without using any webforms technology directly.  Instead, I just produced enough HTML and JavaScript in the ASCX file that is the modules I developed to launch the main JavaScript application. You can check out how this looks on the following pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//www.labelsforeducation.com/My-School/Add-a-School?PostalCode=06410">Find Your School</a></li>
<li><a href="//www.labelsforeducation.com/Earn-Points/Participating-Products">Participating Products</a></li>
<li>The “UPC Lookup” tab on the Participating Products page above</li>
<li>Much of the Signup logic on the <a href="//www.labelsforeducation.com/">LabelsForEducation</a> web site</li>
</ul>
<p>You would be surprised at how very little code is in the codebehind files of my ASCX files that each of my modules live in.</p>
<p>In my current project, I’m using EXTjs and ExtDirect, which is based on WebAPI, to create SPAs.  Nothing that I am currently doing requires that I do the work in either WebForms or MVC.</p>
<p>The beauty of an SPA is that it never officially post back so it doesn’t matter what you are using to hold the main application.</p>
<h2 id="Drawbacks-to-SPAs"><a href="#Drawbacks-to-SPAs" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks to SPAs"></a>Drawbacks to SPAs</h2><p>Having said all of that, there is a major drawback to SPAs.  You have to really know JavaScript, and I’m guessing even though it is the most used language, the number of people who really know JavaScript relative to the number of people it would take to implement a good SPA in a way that can be tested and maintained is relatively few.</p>
<p>Now, I’m sure someone will argue that we still need something.  In fact, as I was discussing this article with some of my peers, we recognized that WebForms and MVC at least allow us to provide page level security.  But even that could be handled using a regular HTML page either by applying the security at the IIS level or by implementing security in the WebAPI and JavaScript.</p>
<p>And what if your page has no interactive components?  Or just a part of the page has some interactive components?  Maybe the bulk of the content comes from a database.  In that case, you can use either and neither  would necessarily be “bad.”</p>
<h2 id="What-About-Database-Driven-Static-Sites"><a href="#What-About-Database-Driven-Static-Sites" class="headerlink" title="What About Database Driven Static Sites?"></a>What About Database Driven Static Sites?</h2><p>The part that is posting back can be implemented using JavaScript and WebAPI.  The rest can be implemented by turning off state management on WebForms and using databinding and Model View Presenter(MVP) or Model View ViewModel (MVVM).  I prefer MVP. Or you can go for MVC and Razor.  Either will essentially get you where you need to go and be relatively light weight.  Although one could make the argument that MVC will give you more control.  The question you have to ask though is, if you had the control, would you really use it.  Does the performance gain relative to the traffic you expect to get and the level of experience your developers have make the switch to MVC worth it?  Would it make more sense to concentrate training efforts on improving JavaScript and WebAPI skills?  Just some things to think about.</p>
<p>So, stop arguing about WebForms vs MVC and put all of that energy into REALLY learning JavaScript, CSS, and HTML because that is where you will be spending a huge hunk of your time in the future as a web application programmer.</p>
<p>The Internet has moved on.  HTML, CSS and JavaScript aren’t just designer eye candy toys anymore.  They are first class development tools that you need to learn now if you plan on being marketable 5 to 10 years from now.</p>

        <p>loading…</p>
<p>Last week I started on a blog post about the tools I use and it ended up being about the tools I use for blogging and podcasting. Today I thought I’d work on something a little more generic and look at what’s in my Visual Studio toolbox.</p>
<h2 id="ReSharper"><a href="#ReSharper" class="headerlink" title="ReSharper"></a>ReSharper</h2><p>This is my main tool.  I like it so much that I think, at this point, I would be pretty lost without it.  Why?</p>
<h4 id="On-the-fly-code-analysis"><a href="#On-the-fly-code-analysis" class="headerlink" title="* On the fly code analysis"></a>* On the fly code analysis</h4><p>ReSharper tells me when I’ve made a stupid mistake long before I’ve actually compiled my code.  It even does this for code that isn’t compiled, like JavaScript.  Catching many of the really stupid errors that I make.</p>
<h4 id="Automatic-Code-Refactoring"><a href="#Automatic-Code-Refactoring" class="headerlink" title="* Automatic Code Refactoring"></a>* Automatic Code Refactoring</h4><p>Not only can it tell you that you’ve made a mistake, but it can also suggest better ways of coding.  I initially learned LINQ by letting ReSharper convert many of my foreach loops into LINQ code. Do you have a variable that you’ve declared a million miles from where it is actually used? ReSharper can move the declaration closer to where it is being used. Do you need to change the name of a method or property, no need to recompile to find all of the places you were using that.  ReSharper can do a lot of that work for you.  The only place where it can’t is if you are referencing the property or method in a string.</p>
<h4 id="Improved-Intellisense"><a href="#Improved-Intellisense" class="headerlink" title="* Improved Intellisense"></a>* Improved Intellisense</h4><p>OK.  So, before I got ReSharper, I didn’t know what I was missing.  But not only will ReSharper tell you what is possible, if you type something in, and it isn’t available because you are missing a reference to a DLL, and it can figure out what DLL should be referenced, it will ask you if you want to add the reference. Similarly, if you add a reference to a class in your code and you have not yet added a using statement, you’ll be asked if you’d like to add the using statement to your code.  Sweet! Ever copied code from another file?  When you paste it in, you typically have to add references to using statements as a second step.  Figuring that all out takes time. Resharper ask you if you’d like to add the using statements immediately after pasting the code.</p>
<h4 id="Coding-Standards"><a href="#Coding-Standards" class="headerlink" title="* Coding Standards"></a>* Coding Standards</h4><p>I’ve always been a big fan of naming conventions.  ReSharper can help you maintain those coding standards. You can get a free 30 day trial at <a href="//www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">JetBrains</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Web-Essentials"><a href="#Web-Essentials" class="headerlink" title="Web Essentials"></a>Web Essentials</h2><p><a href="//vswebessentials.com/">Web Essentials is a free plugin for Visual Studio</a> that adds a few more tricks to Visual Studio web development. I first found this when I got interested in LESS.  But I’ve become pretty dependent on it.  Many of the features that first show up in Web Essentials eventually show up in Visual Studio.  So, you can think of Web Essentials as Visual Studio vNext. I particularly like the enhancements this plugin adds to my CSS and JavaScript coding.</p>
<h2 id="Productivity-Power-Tools"><a href="#Productivity-Power-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Productivity Power Tools"></a>Productivity Power Tools</h2><p>I originally got the the <a href="//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dbcb8670-889e-4a54-a226-a48a15e4cace?SRC=Home">Productivity Power Tools</a> because it has a “Present On” command that lets you bump up the font size of Visual Studio.  Not just the window you are working on.  I use this quite a bit when I present code. But since I got it, I’ve also fallen in love with the feature that puts a squigly in my solution explorer indicating where I have errors in my code.  By turning on JsHint in Web Essentials and using this squigly feature, I’ve been able to keep my JavaScript code clean.</p>
<h2 id="Others"><a href="#Others" class="headerlink" title="Others"></a>Others</h2><p>So, those are the main tools that I use and that I think everyone should include in their toolbox.  But here are a few others you might want to take a look at.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//ankhsvn.open.collab.net/">AnkhSVN</a> – Access SubVersion From Visual Studio</li>
<li><a href="//www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> -  Behavior Driven Development testing tool that works with multiple test runners.</li>
<li><a href="//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/76293c4d-8c16-4f4a-aee6-21f83a571496?SRC=VSIDE">Code Maid</a></li>
<li><a href="//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f85a7ab9-b4c2-436c-a6e5-0f06e0bac16d">Code Lens</a> This only works with Visual Studio Ultimate.  It provides code metrics to help you keep your code maintainable.</li>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Last week I wrote a post that talked about Unit Testing and the need to make sure you are only testing one particular unit of code at a time.  The post was well received.  But I am surprised that no one commented on the glaring hole I left in the post.</p>
<p>In that post, I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, one way you might go about separating your code from the data is by using dependency injection.  What I’m talking about here is simple injection.  No frameworks.</p>
<p>So, let’s say you have a class you may have called user role.  Given a user id, it will return a role.  How could we code this so that it doesn’t matter where the code comes from?</p>
<p>By declaring an interface to a user role object maybe and then passing an object of that type to the constructor.</p>
<p>By doing this, you can use a fake object when you are testing and a real object when you are using the system in production, but your code won’t really care which one is being used.</p>
<p>At some point we will need to retrieve data.  But the data is always just a side effect.  If you have a way of getting at the data, and you are confident it works, because that standard mechanism has been tested, then you don’t need to write test for the data access piece, you only need to write test for “given I have good data, this method will do this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I reflected on the post, I realized that this may make sense to you if you are already implementing this in your code.  But, if you are new to dependency injection and the concepts of loose coupling in general, this might be a foreign concept for you.</p>
<p>At the very least, I realize now that it could be flushed out a bit more.</p>
<p>So, here we go.</p>
<h2 id="N-Tiered-Architectures"><a href="#N-Tiered-Architectures" class="headerlink" title="N-Tiered Architectures"></a>N-Tiered Architectures</h2><p>There are two primary architectural patterns in the coding ecosystem that I live in.  The first, which has been around for a very long time is the N-Tiered, or 3 Tiered architecture.  The main point of this is to separate the Presentation from the Business rules from the retrieval of the data.</p>
<p>Code written using this model normally has the view code dependent on the business logic code which is dependent on the data retrieval code.  And, even though we can use interfaces and dependency injection code to swap out each layer, most of the code written using this architecture that I’ve seen ends up being far too dependent on the code under it than it should be.</p>
<h2 id="MVC-or-MVP"><a href="#MVC-or-MVP" class="headerlink" title="MVC or MVP"></a>MVC or MVP</h2><p>The second architectural pattern I see a lot of is the Model View Controller(MVC) pattern and it’s close cousin, Model View Presenter(MVP).  This pattern also attempts to separate the presentation, and the data and uses the controller as the way of moving the data between the two.  In this pattern, you will often see the controller or presenter layer used as the location of the business logic.  But strictly speaking that’s not the intended purpose.  When the controller or presenter is used for business logic you end up with a similar problem here that we end up with in a strict 3 tiered architecture.  The code ends up being far too dependent on either the architecture or the specific implementation of the architecture.</p>
<h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>Now here’s the deal.  And I think this is where many people go astray with architectural patterns.  Just because you are using 3 Tier, MVC, or MVP (or whatever) doesn’t mean that all of your code HAS to fit into the mold of being one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a View,</li>
<li>a Controller, Presenter or Business layer, or</li>
<li>a Data Access Layer or Model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about this.  How much of the code you’ve written, were you to really switch out the view, would have to be rewritten?  How much of your code could withstand the jarring effect of changing how you accessed the data.</p>
<p>And I’m not talking a simple change.  From the data side we have multiple ways of accessing data in .NET.  We can use LINQ, we can use typed DataSets, we can use some ORM tool.  Say you decided to switch from whatever it is you are using now to one of the others.  Could you do that easily?</p>
<p>And all of this points out the main issue I see with these frameworks.  The frameworks are only there as a way of moving data around.  With each of these it is expected that we will implement the actual presentation, business logic, and data access in an architectural agnostic way.</p>
<p>Which finally brings us back to the comment I made last week.</p>
<h2 id="The-Fix"><a href="#The-Fix" class="headerlink" title="The Fix"></a>The Fix</h2><p>All of your business logic shouldn’t really care where it got its data from.  It should not know where the data came from.  It should not request its own data.  It should be handed data in a form that can be used regardless of what the presentation layer looks like or what the data access layer looks like.</p>
<p>In a three tiered model, the middle layer should work like the controller or the presenter.  It should retrieve the data from either the data layer or the presentation layer and then hand that data off to some other class that will do whatever processing needs to be done, get the return value from it and then pass it on to either the view or the data access layer.  In order to make the actual processing of the data from the view or the data access layer testable, the code we write must be architecturally, and framework agnostic.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the presentation layer, if you have validations that you need to run on the screen, those validations need to be written in such a way that it won’t matter if or how the presentation layer changes.</p>
<p>And here, once again, we point out, you won’t even know this is an issue if you aren’t trying to UNIT test your code.</p>

        <p>One of the problems I had when I started to learn unit testing, and a concept that seems to be hard to grasp as I teach others about unit testing, is this concept of testing just a unit.  What is a unit after all?</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-“Unit”"><a href="#What-is-a-“Unit”" class="headerlink" title="What is a “Unit”?"></a>What is a “Unit”?</h2><p>Simply, a unit is one feature or functionality that your application needs to perform.  The problem I see most people have is not that they don’t know how to test a unit so much as they don’t understand what “a feature” or “a function”. This is best illustrated by a recent testing problem. The feature that was being introduced was a classic role based security issue with a twist.  A user could be one of three different roles.  But the record they are trying to view could also be part of three separate roles.  You can look at a record based on the intersection of the two. How would we test this?  More accurately, how would you design this so that you could test this? If you think of the problem as “can we log in?”, you will attempt to test this as one unit.  But you actually have at least three units to this problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>What role is the logged in user</li>
<li>What role is the record you are trying to view</li>
<li>Given a particular user role and a particular record role, can the user view the record.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we have three user roles, and three record roles, this means we will need three test for each of the user and record role functions and nine test for the can a user see a record.</p>
<p>To be able to test this properly, we will also need to ensure we have three separate methods, and possibly three separate classes in our system.</p>
<h2 id="Why-is-testing-“Units”-difficult-to-understand"><a href="#Why-is-testing-“Units”-difficult-to-understand" class="headerlink" title="Why is testing “Units” difficult to understand?"></a>Why is testing “Units” difficult to understand?</h2><p>But now that we’ve broken out the problem, we will probably still run into  trouble when we start to creat test for this because, if you are like most of the programmers I know, you’ll make at least one of these methods call down to your data access layer in order to figure out what role who is in. Now, I understand why you might do this.  Most of our code looks something like this: View –&gt; Business Rules –&gt; Data That is, the view calls down to the business rules which calls down to the data. The problem with this way of thinking about your code is that you will always have dependencies on other code futher down the chain making the code nearly impossible to ‘unit’ test. What you will need to do, instead, is to think about how you will test this code as you are coding.  You’ve heard me say it before, but this is one of the benefits of unit testing.  It makes you think about the design from two different perspectives, which ultimately makes you code more solid and more flexible. So, one way you might go about separating your code from the data is by using dependency injection.  What I’m talking about here is simple injection.  No frameworks. So, let’s say you have a class you may have called user role.  Given a user id, it will return a role.  How could we code this so that it doesn’t matter where the code comes from? By declaring an interface to a user role object maybe and then passing an object of that type to the constructor. By doing this, you can use a fake object when you are testing and a real object when you are using the system in production, but your code won’t really care which one is being used. At some point we will need to retrieve data.  But the data is always just a side effect.  If you have a way of getting at the data, and you are confident it works, because that standard mechanism has been tested, then you don’t need to write test for the data access piece, you only need to write test for “given I have good data, this method will do this.”</p>
<h2 id="Why-Unit-Test-Generation-Tools-Are-Dangerous"><a href="#Why-Unit-Test-Generation-Tools-Are-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="Why Unit Test Generation Tools Are Dangerous"></a>Why Unit Test Generation Tools Are Dangerous</h2><p>Maybe you’ve noticed tools that will look at your class and create unit test for each of the public methods.  Maybe you think, “cool, I’ll get one of those and it will tell me what to write test for!”  But if you don’t understand what you are testing, these tools can leave quite a bit out of the picture.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a method that you need to test that has two parameters and depends on a property being set, you have all of the test that you need to write to make sure it does what it is suppose to do.  But you also have several test that you need to write when bad parameters get passed in.  Test that a tool can’t stub out for you because it doesn’t know anything other than that you have a method with two parameters.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that test generation tools aren’t helpful.  But, as with most tools, they only become helpful once you understand how to test by hand.</p>
