<p>As many of you know, I’ve been using <a href="//www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> to do my website testing.  And, if you’ve done any testing with Selenium yourself, you know that Selenium can be even slower if you are using Selenium Grid. There are several things you might do today to achieve Selenium Performance improvements in order to increase the speed that your of your test run.</p>
<h2 id="CacheLookup-attribute-or-Annotation-if-you-are-using-Java"><a href="#CacheLookup-attribute-or-Annotation-if-you-are-using-Java" class="headerlink" title="CacheLookup attribute (or Annotation if you are using Java)"></a>CacheLookup attribute (or Annotation if you are using Java)</h2><p>This is probably the most obvious place for improvement.  Assuming you are using the Page Model pattern in your testing, your page model should have properties that already look something like:</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using = “radioButton”)]<br>private IWebElement RadioButton{ get; set;};</p>
<p>What you may not know is that the way this works is that EVERY time you access the property named RadioButton it will lookup the location of the radio button.  The RadioButton property is actually a proxy for the real IWebElement that it will lookup on the fly. So, if you are using the element more than once in your test, it will perform the lookup each time you access the RadioButton property. By adding the CacheLookup attribute to the RadioButton property,</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using = “radioButton”), CacheLookup]<br>private IWebElement RadioButton{ get; set;};</p>
<p>you can force the RadioButton to be resolved once and only once. Most of my test ask for elements once per test, so I didn’t see any major performance gains by adding this.  Your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2 id="CacheLookup-Warning"><a href="#CacheLookup-Warning" class="headerlink" title="CacheLookup Warning"></a>CacheLookup Warning</h2><p>Be careful when adding CacheLookup to your properties because any time the HTML is recreated, the element will become “stale” and you’ll need to look it up again. For example, in one of the pages I’m testing, I have two modal windows that get created as part of the test.  Each time they are created, they have to be resolved again because the old ones no longer exist. It would be like trying to reference a pointer to an object that no longer exist because something else deleted it.  Actually, that’s exactly what is happening.</p>
<h2 id="CacheLookup-Only-Solves-One-of-Your-Problems"><a href="#CacheLookup-Only-Solves-One-of-Your-Problems" class="headerlink" title="CacheLookup Only Solves One of Your Problems"></a>CacheLookup Only Solves One of Your Problems</h2><p>But if all you do to your site is add CacheLookup, you are wasting your time.  You have to start thinking like your code. Did you know that every time you access a property on an IWebElement, Selenium has to make a call to the browser to access the current value? Yep. Actually, if you think about it, this is what you hope it does.  It is what makes code like this work:</p>
<p>Wait.Until(x =&gt; Page.RadioButton.GetAttrinbute(“disabled”));</p>
<p>But how many times to we write code that goes after a property multiple times when we know the value, or at least we assume the value, hasn’t changed? Or how many of you are doing the same thing multiple times in the same test? For example, in the code I’m testing currently, I have a header and a footer that I need to hide so that when an element is scrolled into view by Selenium, it doesn’t scroll under the header or the footer. I’m currently hiding and showing every time I perform some action on an element.  But now that I’m starting to think about performance, I’m asking myself, “What was I thinking?!” In this case, I would save a lot of time by turning the header off once a the beginning of my test.  I bet my test end up running twice as fast simply by doing that. So, keep in mind that every Selenium call you make is probably going to have to access the server in order to perform the action or retrieve the value you are looking for and try to write your code so that you are only making that call to the server one time per test. I bet you see some performance improvements.</p>

<p>I just finished listening to a <a href="//www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1033">DotNetRocks podcast today with Paul Sheriff</a> which largely talked about creating mobile web sites using ASP.NET WebForms.</p>
<p>During the show they discuss when you might use WebForms vs MVC and pointed out that WebForms still have their place, particularly in the corporate world, since they are just as testable as MVC and yet much easier to get something up and running quickly.  This is in contrast to a public facing site that might need to be as light weight as possible and therefore need the extra control that MVC can give you.</p>
<p>And then there is the issue of legacy code.  As they mentioned in the podcast, just because Microsoft has introduced a new technology, doesn’t mean we all have to go re-implement our websites in that technology the next day.  It doesn’t even mean we have to ever implement that technology.  It is just another option in our toolbox.  It is our job as developers and architects to know when the right time to use what technology is based on the requirements of the application and the skill set of our development team.</p>
<p><a href="/aspnet-mvc-is-the-grass-really-greener/">These are Points I’ve made in the past.</a></p>
<h2 id="The-War-Is-Over"><a href="#The-War-Is-Over" class="headerlink" title="The War Is Over"></a>The War Is Over</h2><p>The point I want to make today is this.  The war is over already.  I am surprised that this is still a conversation that the community is having.  Both sides have “lost” to a sneak attack by SPAs.  If this is still a conversation you think is worth having, I would suggest that you may be behind the learning curve.  The .NET world has moved on.</p>
<p>That is, client side models and frameworks have taken over.  What you use to produce the HTML that all lives in, is of very minor concern at best.</p>
<p>I suppose if you are interested in creating applications that are old style forms that post content to the server and refresh the page content or move on to another page, you might be interested in continuing to fight this war.  But in my world, most of the applications I work on could be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript calling back to a server that consumes and produces JSON.  In .NET, that would mean using WebAPI, which, while based on MVC, isn’t MVC.</p>
<h2 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h2><p>For some examples of this, check out the LabelsForEducation site which is a DotNetNuke site.  DotNetNuke is a CMS based on WebForms technology.  By using jQuery and knockout, I was able to create the interactive portions of the site without using any webforms technology directly.  Instead, I just produced enough HTML and JavaScript in the ASCX file that is the modules I developed to launch the main JavaScript application. You can check out how this looks on the following pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//www.labelsforeducation.com/My-School/Add-a-School?PostalCode=06410">Find Your School</a></li>
<li><a href="//www.labelsforeducation.com/Earn-Points/Participating-Products">Participating Products</a></li>
<li>The “UPC Lookup” tab on the Participating Products page above</li>
<li>Much of the Signup logic on the <a href="//www.labelsforeducation.com/">LabelsForEducation</a> web site</li>
</ul>
<p>You would be surprised at how very little code is in the codebehind files of my ASCX files that each of my modules live in.</p>
<p>In my current project, I’m using EXTjs and ExtDirect, which is based on WebAPI, to create SPAs.  Nothing that I am currently doing requires that I do the work in either WebForms or MVC.</p>
<p>The beauty of an SPA is that it never officially post back so it doesn’t matter what you are using to hold the main application.</p>
<h2 id="Drawbacks-to-SPAs"><a href="#Drawbacks-to-SPAs" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks to SPAs"></a>Drawbacks to SPAs</h2><p>Having said all of that, there is a major drawback to SPAs.  You have to really know JavaScript, and I’m guessing even though it is the most used language, the number of people who really know JavaScript relative to the number of people it would take to implement a good SPA in a way that can be tested and maintained is relatively few.</p>
<p>Now, I’m sure someone will argue that we still need something.  In fact, as I was discussing this article with some of my peers, we recognized that WebForms and MVC at least allow us to provide page level security.  But even that could be handled using a regular HTML page either by applying the security at the IIS level or by implementing security in the WebAPI and JavaScript.</p>
<p>And what if your page has no interactive components?  Or just a part of the page has some interactive components?  Maybe the bulk of the content comes from a database.  In that case, you can use either and neither  would necessarily be “bad.”</p>
<h2 id="What-About-Database-Driven-Static-Sites"><a href="#What-About-Database-Driven-Static-Sites" class="headerlink" title="What About Database Driven Static Sites?"></a>What About Database Driven Static Sites?</h2><p>The part that is posting back can be implemented using JavaScript and WebAPI.  The rest can be implemented by turning off state management on WebForms and using databinding and Model View Presenter(MVP) or Model View ViewModel (MVVM).  I prefer MVP. Or you can go for MVC and Razor.  Either will essentially get you where you need to go and be relatively light weight.  Although one could make the argument that MVC will give you more control.  The question you have to ask though is, if you had the control, would you really use it.  Does the performance gain relative to the traffic you expect to get and the level of experience your developers have make the switch to MVC worth it?  Would it make more sense to concentrate training efforts on improving JavaScript and WebAPI skills?  Just some things to think about.</p>
<p>So, stop arguing about WebForms vs MVC and put all of that energy into REALLY learning JavaScript, CSS, and HTML because that is where you will be spending a huge hunk of your time in the future as a web application programmer.</p>
<p>The Internet has moved on.  HTML, CSS and JavaScript aren’t just designer eye candy toys anymore.  They are first class development tools that you need to learn now if you plan on being marketable 5 to 10 years from now.</p>

        <p>loading…</p>
<p>Last week I started on a blog post about the tools I use and it ended up being about the tools I use for blogging and podcasting. Today I thought I’d work on something a little more generic and look at what’s in my Visual Studio toolbox.</p>
<h2 id="ReSharper"><a href="#ReSharper" class="headerlink" title="ReSharper"></a>ReSharper</h2><p>This is my main tool.  I like it so much that I think, at this point, I would be pretty lost without it.  Why?</p>
<h4 id="On-the-fly-code-analysis"><a href="#On-the-fly-code-analysis" class="headerlink" title="* On the fly code analysis"></a>* On the fly code analysis</h4><p>ReSharper tells me when I’ve made a stupid mistake long before I’ve actually compiled my code.  It even does this for code that isn’t compiled, like JavaScript.  Catching many of the really stupid errors that I make.</p>
<h4 id="Automatic-Code-Refactoring"><a href="#Automatic-Code-Refactoring" class="headerlink" title="* Automatic Code Refactoring"></a>* Automatic Code Refactoring</h4><p>Not only can it tell you that you’ve made a mistake, but it can also suggest better ways of coding.  I initially learned LINQ by letting ReSharper convert many of my foreach loops into LINQ code. Do you have a variable that you’ve declared a million miles from where it is actually used? ReSharper can move the declaration closer to where it is being used. Do you need to change the name of a method or property, no need to recompile to find all of the places you were using that.  ReSharper can do a lot of that work for you.  The only place where it can’t is if you are referencing the property or method in a string.</p>
<h4 id="Improved-Intellisense"><a href="#Improved-Intellisense" class="headerlink" title="* Improved Intellisense"></a>* Improved Intellisense</h4><p>OK.  So, before I got ReSharper, I didn’t know what I was missing.  But not only will ReSharper tell you what is possible, if you type something in, and it isn’t available because you are missing a reference to a DLL, and it can figure out what DLL should be referenced, it will ask you if you want to add the reference. Similarly, if you add a reference to a class in your code and you have not yet added a using statement, you’ll be asked if you’d like to add the using statement to your code.  Sweet! Ever copied code from another file?  When you paste it in, you typically have to add references to using statements as a second step.  Figuring that all out takes time. Resharper ask you if you’d like to add the using statements immediately after pasting the code.</p>
<h4 id="Coding-Standards"><a href="#Coding-Standards" class="headerlink" title="* Coding Standards"></a>* Coding Standards</h4><p>I’ve always been a big fan of naming conventions.  ReSharper can help you maintain those coding standards. You can get a free 30 day trial at <a href="//www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">JetBrains</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Web-Essentials"><a href="#Web-Essentials" class="headerlink" title="Web Essentials"></a>Web Essentials</h2><p><a href="//vswebessentials.com/">Web Essentials is a free plugin for Visual Studio</a> that adds a few more tricks to Visual Studio web development. I first found this when I got interested in LESS.  But I’ve become pretty dependent on it.  Many of the features that first show up in Web Essentials eventually show up in Visual Studio.  So, you can think of Web Essentials as Visual Studio vNext. I particularly like the enhancements this plugin adds to my CSS and JavaScript coding.</p>
<h2 id="Productivity-Power-Tools"><a href="#Productivity-Power-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Productivity Power Tools"></a>Productivity Power Tools</h2><p>I originally got the the <a href="//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dbcb8670-889e-4a54-a226-a48a15e4cace?SRC=Home">Productivity Power Tools</a> because it has a “Present On” command that lets you bump up the font size of Visual Studio.  Not just the window you are working on.  I use this quite a bit when I present code. But since I got it, I’ve also fallen in love with the feature that puts a squigly in my solution explorer indicating where I have errors in my code.  By turning on JsHint in Web Essentials and using this squigly feature, I’ve been able to keep my JavaScript code clean.</p>
<h2 id="Others"><a href="#Others" class="headerlink" title="Others"></a>Others</h2><p>So, those are the main tools that I use and that I think everyone should include in their toolbox.  But here are a few others you might want to take a look at.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//ankhsvn.open.collab.net/">AnkhSVN</a> – Access SubVersion From Visual Studio</li>
<li><a href="//www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> -  Behavior Driven Development testing tool that works with multiple test runners.</li>
<li><a href="//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/76293c4d-8c16-4f4a-aee6-21f83a571496?SRC=VSIDE">Code Maid</a></li>
<li><a href="//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f85a7ab9-b4c2-436c-a6e5-0f06e0bac16d">Code Lens</a> This only works with Visual Studio Ultimate.  It provides code metrics to help you keep your code maintainable.</li>

<p>So, one way you might go about separating your code from the data is by using dependency injection.  What I’m talking about here is simple injection.  No frameworks.</p>
<p>So, let’s say you have a class you may have called user role.  Given a user id, it will return a role.  How could we code this so that it doesn’t matter where the code comes from?</p>
<p>By declaring an interface to a user role object maybe and then passing an object of that type to the constructor.</p>
<p>By doing this, you can use a fake object when you are testing and a real object when you are using the system in production, but your code won’t really care which one is being used.</p>
<p>At some point we will need to retrieve data.  But the data is always just a side effect.  If you have a way of getting at the data, and you are confident it works, because that standard mechanism has been tested, then you don’t need to write test for the data access piece, you only need to write test for “given I have good data, this method will do this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I reflected on the post, I realized that this may make sense to you if you are already implementing this in your code.  But, if you are new to dependency injection and the concepts of loose coupling in general, this might be a foreign concept for you.</p>
<p>At the very least, I realize now that it could be flushed out a bit more.</p>
<p>So, here we go.</p>
<h2 id="N-Tiered-Architectures"><a href="#N-Tiered-Architectures" class="headerlink" title="N-Tiered Architectures"></a>N-Tiered Architectures</h2><p>There are two primary architectural patterns in the coding ecosystem that I live in.  The first, which has been around for a very long time is the N-Tiered, or 3 Tiered architecture.  The main point of this is to separate the Presentation from the Business rules from the retrieval of the data.</p>
<p>Code written using this model normally has the view code dependent on the business logic code which is dependent on the data retrieval code.  And, even though we can use interfaces and dependency injection code to swap out each layer, most of the code written using this architecture that I’ve seen ends up being far too dependent on the code under it than it should be.</p>
<h2 id="MVC-or-MVP"><a href="#MVC-or-MVP" class="headerlink" title="MVC or MVP"></a>MVC or MVP</h2><p>The second architectural pattern I see a lot of is the Model View Controller(MVC) pattern and it’s close cousin, Model View Presenter(MVP).  This pattern also attempts to separate the presentation, and the data and uses the controller as the way of moving the data between the two.  In this pattern, you will often see the controller or presenter layer used as the location of the business logic.  But strictly speaking that’s not the intended purpose.  When the controller or presenter is used for business logic you end up with a similar problem here that we end up with in a strict 3 tiered architecture.  The code ends up being far too dependent on either the architecture or the specific implementation of the architecture.</p>
<h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>Now here’s the deal.  And I think this is where many people go astray with architectural patterns.  Just because you are using 3 Tier, MVC, or MVP (or whatever) doesn’t mean that all of your code HAS to fit into the mold of being one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a View,</li>
<li>a Controller, Presenter or Business layer, or</li>
<li>a Data Access Layer or Model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about this.  How much of the code you’ve written, were you to really switch out the view, would have to be rewritten?  How much of your code could withstand the jarring effect of changing how you accessed the data.</p>
<p>And I’m not talking a simple change.  From the data side we have multiple ways of accessing data in .NET.  We can use LINQ, we can use typed DataSets, we can use some ORM tool.  Say you decided to switch from whatever it is you are using now to one of the others.  Could you do that easily?</p>
<p>And all of this points out the main issue I see with these frameworks.  The frameworks are only there as a way of moving data around.  With each of these it is expected that we will implement the actual presentation, business logic, and data access in an architectural agnostic way.</p>
<p>Which finally brings us back to the comment I made last week.</p>
<h2 id="The-Fix"><a href="#The-Fix" class="headerlink" title="The Fix"></a>The Fix</h2><p>All of your business logic shouldn’t really care where it got its data from.  It should not know where the data came from.  It should not request its own data.  It should be handed data in a form that can be used regardless of what the presentation layer looks like or what the data access layer looks like.</p>
<p>In a three tiered model, the middle layer should work like the controller or the presenter.  It should retrieve the data from either the data layer or the presentation layer and then hand that data off to some other class that will do whatever processing needs to be done, get the return value from it and then pass it on to either the view or the data access layer.  In order to make the actual processing of the data from the view or the data access layer testable, the code we write must be architecturally, and framework agnostic.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the presentation layer, if you have validations that you need to run on the screen, those validations need to be written in such a way that it won’t matter if or how the presentation layer changes.</p>
<p>And here, once again, we point out, you won’t even know this is an issue if you aren’t trying to UNIT test your code.</p>

        <p>One of the problems I had when I started to learn unit testing, and a concept that seems to be hard to grasp as I teach others about unit testing, is this concept of testing just a unit.  What is a unit after all?</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-“Unit”"><a href="#What-is-a-“Unit”" class="headerlink" title="What is a “Unit”?"></a>What is a “Unit”?</h2><p>Simply, a unit is one feature or functionality that your application needs to perform.  The problem I see most people have is not that they don’t know how to test a unit so much as they don’t understand what “a feature” or “a function”. This is best illustrated by a recent testing problem. The feature that was being introduced was a classic role based security issue with a twist.  A user could be one of three different roles.  But the record they are trying to view could also be part of three separate roles.  You can look at a record based on the intersection of the two. How would we test this?  More accurately, how would you design this so that you could test this? If you think of the problem as “can we log in?”, you will attempt to test this as one unit.  But you actually have at least three units to this problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>What role is the logged in user</li>
<li>What role is the record you are trying to view</li>
<li>Given a particular user role and a particular record role, can the user view the record.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we have three user roles, and three record roles, this means we will need three test for each of the user and record role functions and nine test for the can a user see a record.</p>
<p>To be able to test this properly, we will also need to ensure we have three separate methods, and possibly three separate classes in our system.</p>
<h2 id="Why-is-testing-“Units”-difficult-to-understand"><a href="#Why-is-testing-“Units”-difficult-to-understand" class="headerlink" title="Why is testing “Units” difficult to understand?"></a>Why is testing “Units” difficult to understand?</h2><p>But now that we’ve broken out the problem, we will probably still run into  trouble when we start to creat test for this because, if you are like most of the programmers I know, you’ll make at least one of these methods call down to your data access layer in order to figure out what role who is in. Now, I understand why you might do this.  Most of our code looks something like this: View –&gt; Business Rules –&gt; Data That is, the view calls down to the business rules which calls down to the data. The problem with this way of thinking about your code is that you will always have dependencies on other code futher down the chain making the code nearly impossible to ‘unit’ test. What you will need to do, instead, is to think about how you will test this code as you are coding.  You’ve heard me say it before, but this is one of the benefits of unit testing.  It makes you think about the design from two different perspectives, which ultimately makes you code more solid and more flexible. So, one way you might go about separating your code from the data is by using dependency injection.  What I’m talking about here is simple injection.  No frameworks. So, let’s say you have a class you may have called user role.  Given a user id, it will return a role.  How could we code this so that it doesn’t matter where the code comes from? By declaring an interface to a user role object maybe and then passing an object of that type to the constructor. By doing this, you can use a fake object when you are testing and a real object when you are using the system in production, but your code won’t really care which one is being used. At some point we will need to retrieve data.  But the data is always just a side effect.  If you have a way of getting at the data, and you are confident it works, because that standard mechanism has been tested, then you don’t need to write test for the data access piece, you only need to write test for “given I have good data, this method will do this.”</p>
<h2 id="Why-Unit-Test-Generation-Tools-Are-Dangerous"><a href="#Why-Unit-Test-Generation-Tools-Are-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="Why Unit Test Generation Tools Are Dangerous"></a>Why Unit Test Generation Tools Are Dangerous</h2><p>Maybe you’ve noticed tools that will look at your class and create unit test for each of the public methods.  Maybe you think, “cool, I’ll get one of those and it will tell me what to write test for!”  But if you don’t understand what you are testing, these tools can leave quite a bit out of the picture.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a method that you need to test that has two parameters and depends on a property being set, you have all of the test that you need to write to make sure it does what it is suppose to do.  But you also have several test that you need to write when bad parameters get passed in.  Test that a tool can’t stub out for you because it doesn’t know anything other than that you have a method with two parameters.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that test generation tools aren’t helpful.  But, as with most tools, they only become helpful once you understand how to test by hand.</p>

        <p><a href="//www.amazon.com/gp/product/059680279X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=059680279X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=davmbusnetapp-20&amp;linkId=JAJ5BQZSEX6VSPFJ"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=059680279X&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=davmbusnetapp-20" alt></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davmbusnetapp-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=059680279X" alt> So, I started reading <a href="//www.amazon.com/gp/product/059680279X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=059680279X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=davmbusnetapp-20&amp;linkId=JAJ5BQZSEX6VSPFJ"><strong>High Performance JavaScript</strong></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davmbusnetapp-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=059680279X" alt> recently and I thought now might be a good time to give a summary of what I’ve learned so far. Up until recently, I wasn’t all that concerned about performance.  But last year I started working with EXTjs, which allows you to build desktop like apps in JavaScript using pretty much nothing but JavaScript and now performance is a much bigger concern.  It isn’t like the old days where I was supplementing the page with JavaScript.  Now, HTML is supplementing the JavaScript.  Even if you aren’t working on anything quite as intense as what I’m working on now, you are going to want to learn how to write JavaScript in a performant manner because JavaScript is become the language of choice for so much.  It isn’t just a web thing anymore but it shows up in mobile development and servers. The only thing that might make learning how to optimize your JavaScript irrelevant is if you wait until a really good binary compiler comes out that is available everywhere.  Not something I see happening any time soon, much as I’d like that. OK, so that being said here are the two main optimization tweaks I’ve learned so far.</p>
<h2 id="Local-Is-Faster-Than-Anything-Else"><a href="#Local-Is-Faster-Than-Anything-Else" class="headerlink" title="Local Is Faster Than Anything Else"></a>Local Is Faster Than Anything Else</h2><p>If I could boil all of chapter two into one rule.  This would be it.  Any time you are accessing a variable, make sure you turn it into a local variable if you are going to use that data more than once in your local scope. Why is this? Because every time you access a variable the JavaScript runtime engine has to do a lookup to find out where it is.  The first place it looks is in the local scope.  From there it works its way out to the various scopes it has access to. And be careful thinking that just because it is a property, you can ignore this rule.  Even properties take more time than going after a local variable.  At a minimum  it has to do a lookup for the variable that represents the object and another lookup for the property or method attached to that object. In a compiled language, this generally isn’t necessary because these references are all figured out when we compile the code.  So you’ll need to get your head out of “compiled language mode” and back into scripting mode.</p>
<h2 id="Avoid-Accessing-the-DOM"><a href="#Avoid-Accessing-the-DOM" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Accessing the DOM"></a>Avoid Accessing the DOM</h2><p>Yes, I know, this is why we write JavaScript code on the client in the first place.  At least, most of the time it is. But the point of this rule is that we want to avoid accessing the DOM any more than we absolutely have to. Why is this slow? Well, the first reason is the generally the DOM engine and the Scripting engine are in two separate spaces.  So you kind of have to pay a toll every time you access the DOM from JavaScript. Second, manipulating the DOM is slow.  Historically this was not such a huge problem because the DOM was only expected to be rendered once. So what can you do to help your performance? First, once you’ve accessed a DOM element, cache the result on the JavaScript side  of the fence so you don’t need to pay that toll again. Second, don’t do anything in multiple calls that you could do with one. Pretty simple.</p>
<h2 id="What-Else-Is-In-The-Book"><a href="#What-Else-Is-In-The-Book" class="headerlink" title="What Else Is In The Book?"></a>What Else Is In The Book?</h2><ol>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>One of the design principles in software development is to only write what you need today.  This has taken on the moniker of YAGNI (You Aren’t Going To Need It).</p>
<p>The question is, in what ways do we violate this principle?</p>
<h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features:"></a>Features:</h2><p>The most obvious situation where we tend to violate YAGNI is in feature creep.  We design in a new end user feature that seems really cool to us.  We may even try to sell the end user into believing they need the feature.  Maybe it is just eye candy.  “We can make this screen animate when it opens.”</p>
<p>Yeah, but is that a requirement or a nice to have?  How much longer will it take to design that?  How many more bugs will it introduce?</p>
<p>I think most of us get YAGNI at what I would call the “Visible Feature” level.  That is, what the end user will see immediately.</p>
<p>Where I think most of us get this wrong is at the code design and architecture level.</p>
<h2 id="Architecture"><a href="#Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Architecture:"></a>Architecture:</h2><h4 id="Do-you-have-a-tendency-to-over-architect-your-code"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-tendency-to-over-architect-your-code" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a tendency to over architect your code?"></a>Do you have a tendency to over architect your code?</h4><p>This is an impossible question to answer because I think all of us think we architect to just the right level.  So what are some signs that you have gone too far?</p>
<p>Well, one of them might be how you defend your decision to write your code in a particular way.  If your answer is anything remotely like, “We might need it to do…” you are probably over architecting.</p>
<p>For example, when you write your code, are you thinking about all of the ways it might be used in the future?  That business rule you are writing, it might be used as a web service, or need to be accessed by JSON.  You never know.</p>
<p>But really, unless you need it to do all of that stuff today, you are probably spending more time on the code you are writing than you need to.  Why?  Because most of the time all of those, “we might need it to…” never happen.  And when they do happen, they happen in entirely unexpected ways that you can not foresee.</p>
<h4 id="But-it-will-save-time"><a href="#But-it-will-save-time" class="headerlink" title="But it will save time!"></a>But it will save time!</h4><p>Will it?</p>
<p>If your code is so complex that adding in the “it might need to…” in the future is going to take more time than adding it in now, you probably have a fundamental problem with your code.</p>
<p>Worse, as mentioned above, you will probably never need it anyhow.  So, you’ve spent extra time now to save time you wouldn’t spend in the future if you were to just wait until you need it.</p>
<p>Aren’t you busy enough with deadlines as it is?</p>
<h2 id="Prevention"><a href="#Prevention" class="headerlink" title="Prevention:"></a>Prevention:</h2><p>So, then the next question is, “how do we prevent over architecting?”</p>
<p>Simple, you write Unit Test for all of the code you are writing.  If you are writing code so that it can be accessed in multiple ways, you’ll need to write test that prove it can be accessed in multiple ways.  Are you willing to do that?</p>
<p>When the tests need to be updated to reflect new business requirements, are you going to want to update them all?</p>
<p>So the next time you, or someone you knows says, “It might need to…” maybe you should ask them what the chances of them needing that really are and is it worth spending the extra time on it now.</p>

Why?  Because both sides of the equal are converted to numerics and then evaluated.  This gives us, 0 == 1 which is in fact false.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<h2 id="if-“0”"><a href="#if-“0”" class="headerlink" title="if(“0”) "></a>if(“0”) </h2><p>is true.  This is because there is no conversion needed.  Any string is truthy.</p>
<p>OK.  So then, what would you expect</p>
<h2 id="if-“1”-true"><a href="#if-“1”-true" class="headerlink" title="if(“1” === true)"></a>if(“1” === true)</h2><p>to be?  If you said, “true” you would be wrong.  And just when you thought you were getting the hang of this.</p>
<p>This puzzle illustrates the difference between the double equals (==) and triple equals (===) evaluators in JavaScript.  You see, if you use double equals, JavaScript will always convert both sides to a common type and then do the evaluation.  However, triple equals says that both sides have to be the same type and the same value to be equal.  Since a String is not a Boolean type, “1” === true evaluates to false.</p>
<p>Do you think you are getting the hang of this yet?  OK.  What does the next statement evaluate to?</p>
<h2 id="if-”0”-true"><a href="#if-”0”-true" class="headerlink" title="if(!!”0” == true)"></a>if(!!”0” == true)</h2><p>This evaluates to true.  If you thought it would be false, you probably applied the !! after the types were converted.  But the operator precedence on this is to apply the ! operators first.  So ! some valid string is false and ! false is true.  So true == true is true.</p>
<h2 id="The-operator"><a href="#The-operator" class="headerlink" title="The ! operator"></a>The ! operator</h2><p>The next two examples I gave were to simply point out that != is the opposite of double equal and !== is the opposite of triple equal.  Beyond that, they work the same.</p>
<p>So, if(“0” != true) would evaluate to true and if(“0” !== true) would also evaluate to true.</p>
<h2 id="if-someVariable"><a href="#if-someVariable" class="headerlink" title="if(someVariable)"></a>if(someVariable)</h2><p>The last set of examples illustrates what happens if a variable is undefined or null.</p>
<p>Since we never gave someVariable a value, it is undefined and so if(someVariable) would evaluate to false.  Undefined and null variables evaluate to falsy.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean that it is a boolean value.</p>
<p>So, if(someVariable == true) evaluates to false, if(someVariable === false) evaluates to false, if(!someVariable === true) evaluates to true and if(!!someVariable === true) evaluates to false.</p>
<h2 id="Implications"><a href="#Implications" class="headerlink" title="Implications"></a>Implications</h2><p>The main implication of all of this is that if you are going to compare two variables for equality, you should first convert them to a common type and then compare them using the triple equals operator.</p>
<p>However, if you are just evaluating a variable for truthiness, using just the variable, as in if(someVariable) is clear enough.  You don’t gain much by using if(!!someVariable) or even if(!!someVariable === true) syntax.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Running Selenium in parallel from .NET seems to be a problem because, as of the time of this writing, I’ve yet to find a viable way of running selenium test on multiple browsers using <a href="//docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp">Selenium Grid</a>.  This doesn’t mean that there aren’t a few articles out there that have some kind of solution.  But they’ve never satisfied me as something that I could easily plug into my already created test. While my preferred testing tools are <a href="//www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> and <a href="//www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a>, the method I am about to propose should work with any existing test harness you might want to use.  The only prerequisite is that you are using <a href="//code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects">Page Models</a> to wrap your access to any particular web page. This article assumes that you already:</p>
<ul>
<li>know how to write Selenium tests</li>
<li>know how to use Selenium Grid</li>
<li>know how to use the Page Model pattern</li>
<li>know how to use your chosen test harness.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK.  On to the main event.</p>
<h2 id="Here-Is-The-Problem"><a href="#Here-Is-The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Here Is The Problem"></a>Here Is The Problem</h2><p>In order to run multiple browsers at the same time, the easiest way is to provide a wrapper Page Model that calls multiple instances of the page model at the same time. The hard way of doing this would be to create an Interface that represented the real page model and then create a proxy class that would hold a list of all of the real page model objects we needed to call.  Each time a property or method on the proxy gets called, all it would do would be to pass the call down into the real objects in parallel. This would work, but the main draw back is that I really don’t want to have to write a method for each method in my real page model.  So the question is, how can we get around this?</p>
<h2 id="DynamicObject-To-The-Rescue"><a href="#DynamicObject-To-The-Rescue" class="headerlink" title="DynamicObject To The Rescue"></a>DynamicObject To The Rescue</h2><p>Enter the little known class, <a href="//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.dynamic.dynamicobject(v=vs.110">DynamicObject</a>.aspx).   In .NET 4, Microsoft introduced the dynamic keyword.  One of the main uses is for places where  you need to be able to declare a variable in your code that the compiler won’t know how to resolve the type of until runtime.  I could have used this several years ago when I had two assemblies that needed to reference each other.  In that case, I used reflection.  But dynamic would have worked with a lot less work. DynamicObject is a specific class that allows us to resolve property and method calls at runtime using our own logic. We will also use the Task Parallel library to implement our parallel calls. For completeness, and so that no one is confused when they try to implement this code, you’ll need the following using statements at the top of the CS file.</p>
<h2 id="Using-Statements-And-Constructor"><a href="#Using-Statements-And-Constructor" class="headerlink" title="Using Statements And Constructor"></a>Using Statements And Constructor</h2><p>using System;<br>using System.Collections.Concurrent;<br>using System.Dynamic;<br>using System.Reflection;<br>using System.Threading.Tasks;</p>
<p>So, let’s get started.  The first thing we will need is a class declaration:</p>
<p>class ParallelPageModel<tpage>:  DynamicObject<br>{<br>}</tpage></p>
<p>TPage allows us to specify the Interface the real Page Model implements.  Yes, we still need the interface, but we won’t need to create a new wrapper class for every page model we want to wrap.  The class  inherits from DynamicObject so that all of our on the fly goodness will work. Next, we’ll need some place to store an array of PageObjects we want to proxy.  So we add a private variable _page for that purpose.</p>
<p>private readonly TPage[] _pages;</p>
<p>By using TPage[], we create a variable that is the same type array as the Page Models we are proxying. Next we need a constructor.</p>
<p>ParallelPageModel(params TPage[] pages)<br>{<br>    _pages = pages;<br>}</p>
<p>By using the params keyword, we can either  pass in page objects as an array or as individual parameters. The magic happens in three overridden methods that are in DynamicObject:</p>
<ul>
<li>TryInvokeMember – resolves any method calls.</li>
<li>TrySetMember – resolves any property setters</li>
<li>TryGetMember – resolves any property getters</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s add those methods next:</p>
<p>public override bool TryInvokeMember<br>    (InvokeMemberBinder binder,<br>      object[] args,<br>      out object result)<br>{<br>}</p>
<p>public override bool TrySetMember<br>    (SetMemberBinder binder, object value)<br>{<br>}</p>
<p>public override bool TryGetMember<br>    (GetMemberBinder binder, out object result)<br>{<br>}</p>
<h2 id="TryInvokeMember"><a href="#TryInvokeMember" class="headerlink" title="TryInvokeMember"></a>TryInvokeMember</h2><p>Inside of the TryInvokeMember method, the first thing we will want to do is to use reflection to call into the real methods.  Since we could have multiple instances of the same method we need to call we will want to do this in a loop. When I first worked this out, I started by just implementing a foreach loop but we are going to jump right to using Parallel.ForEach() Parallel.ForEach() will let us pass in an array and run a lambda expression on each element in the array.  So, our foreach loop will look like this:</p>
<p>var results = new ConcurrentBag<object>();<br>Parallel.ForEach(_pages, page =&gt;<br>{<br>    var thisResult = typeof (TPage)<br>       .InvokeMember(binder.Name,<br>        BindingFlags.InvokeMethod |<br>        BindingFlags.Public |<br>        BindingFlags.Instance,<br>        null, page, args);<br>    results.Add(thisResult);<br>});</object></p>
<p>Note that our lambda expression is not doing anything more than a simple reflection call. The result that is returned is added to our ConcurrentBag collection.  ConcurrentBag is a collection that is specifically made for parallel calls.  We could get into trouble if we added something to a List&lt;&gt; collection unless we added some parallelization gatekeeping around it.  I’m for doing as little work as possible. The second thing we want to do is to process the return results. For this we need to setup a basic foreach loop.</p>
<p>foreach (var thisResult in results)<br>{<br>}</p>
<p>Inside the foreach loop we will process the results collection. If the type that got  returned is the same type as the type that the page is proxying for, we just make our result value, the return value the TryInvokeMember is going to return for us to the code that called the proxy, equal to the proxy object.</p>
<p>if (thisResult is TPage)<br>{<br>    result = this;<br>}</p>
<p>If the result is not null, meaning either that a previous result was null or we haven’t processed the loop yet, we want to check to see if the value of the current loop result is the same as the loop results we’ve already processed.  If it isn’t, we throw an exception.</p>
<p>else if (result != null)<br>{<br>    if (!result.Equals(thisResult)) // not the same value<br>    {<br>        throw new Exception<br>           (“Call to method returns different values.”);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>Finally, we just set the result to whatever we have at this point.</p>
<p>else<br>{<br>    result = thisResult;<br>}</p>
<p>And then the last thing we want to do is to return true to tell the system we were able to process the method.</p>
<h2 id="TryGetMember"><a href="#TryGetMember" class="headerlink" title="TryGetMember"></a>TryGetMember</h2><p>Since the implementation for TryGetMember looks very similar to TryInvokeMethod we’ll tackle that next. In fact, the only difference between the two methods is the code inside of the Parallel.ForEach parameter block. So, here it is:</p>
<p>Parallel.ForEach(_pages, page =&gt;<br>{<br>    var thisResult = typeof(TPage)<br>        .GetProperty(binder.Name).GetValue(page);<br>    results.Add(thisResult);<br>});</p>
<h2 id="TrySetMember"><a href="#TrySetMember" class="headerlink" title="TrySetMember"></a>TrySetMember</h2><p>TrySetMember is the easiest implementation of all since there are no results to worry about.</p>
<p>Parallel.ForEach(_pages,<br>     page =&gt; typeof (TPage)<br>        .GetProperty(binder.Name).SetValue(page, value));<br>return true;</p>
<h2 id="Casting"><a href="#Casting" class="headerlink" title="Casting"></a>Casting</h2><p>So the code above will work, but you won’t get any intellisense help from Visual Studio if you use this code without tweaking it. What we need is some way of casting the ParallelPageModel object to the TPage type that we pass in. For that we are going to use a cool library I found called <a href="//github.com/ekonbenefits/impromptu-interface">ImpromptuInterface</a>. You’ll need to add a using statement.</p>
<p>using ImpromptuInterface;</p>
<p>And then you’ll need to add this method to the ParallelPageModel class.</p>
<p>public TPage Cast()<br>{<br>    return this.ActLike();<br>}</p>
<p>You would use this like this:</p>
<p>IMyPageModel p = pageModelProxy.Cast();</p>
<p>Where IMyPageModel is the interface that specifies what your real PageModel class looks like. Just in case someone is tempted to mention this in the comments, you can’t us operator overloading to achieve the cast because we need it to return TPage, which could be anything and the compiler can’t deal with that.  If you really want to use operator overloading you’ll need to provide your own specific implementation that ends up calling the code above.</p>
<h2 id="Calling-The-ParallelPageModel"><a href="#Calling-The-ParallelPageModel" class="headerlink" title="Calling The ParallelPageModel"></a>Calling The ParallelPageModel</h2><p>To setup the ParallelPageModel, your code would look something like this, assuming that you have a page model class called MyPageModel with an interface of IMyPageModel.</p>
<p>var pages = new ConcurrentStack<imypagemodel>();<br>Parallel.Invoke(<br>    () =><br>        pages.Push(PageFactory.GetPageModel(“FireFoxGrid”),<br>    () =><br>        pages.Push(PageFactory.GetPageModel(“IE11Grid”));<br>var pagesArray = pages.ToArray();<br>MyTypedPage =<br>    new ParallelPageModel<imypagemodel>(pagesArray).Cast();</imypagemodel></imypagemodel></p>
<h2 id="Considerations"><a href="#Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Considerations"></a>Considerations</h2><p>I only just started using this.  It works for my current implementation.  But you may need to tweak it so that it works for you. For example, my assumption here is that you are only dealing with simple types or the page model type you are a proxy for.  There is no code here that will handle a situation where the call to a method would return a entirely new page model. Since the code I am testing is a collection of Single Page Applications and I am not testing navigation at this point, this is not a consideration for me.  But it would be relatively easy code to implement.  If I did that, I would probably handle it but subclassing this main class that does the bulk of the work and override the Try*Member method that needed to deal with that situation.  The other possible way of dealing with the situation is to pass in a list of types that need to be wrapped in their own parallelization object as parameters in the constructor and add some generic code in the ParallelPageModel class. Finally, I am well aware that this code may have bugs.  If you find one, go ahead and fix it. You can leave a comment so that others will benefit.   There is a <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/ParallelSeleniumUsingNUnit">demo project on GitHub.</a></p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Last week I mentioned that I’m working toward getting my MCSD certification.  Several weeks ago I received my <a href="//www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/dbush2">ScrumMaster Certification</a>.  This raises the question, “Why get certified at all?” What follows is a list of reasons why I am perusing certification.</p>
<h2 id="I-don’t-know-what-I-don’t-know"><a href="#I-don’t-know-what-I-don’t-know" class="headerlink" title="I don’t know what I don’t know"></a>I don’t know what I don’t know</h2><p>I know what I know.  And I can figure stuff out pretty fast when I need to know it.  So working without certification has been working for me for a pretty long time.  However, while I was studying for my ScrumMaster Certification, I realized that while I had most of the concepts right, there where a few holes in my thinking.  Studying for the ScrumMaster certification filled in those holes.</p>
<h2 id="Authority"><a href="#Authority" class="headerlink" title="Authority"></a>Authority</h2><p>The reason I went after ScrumMaster certification was because everywhere I go, everyone has  their own definition of what Scrum looks like.  Most of them only know about Scrum from what they’ve heard about it from very informal sources. Only one that I know of is certified. But when I was talking about Scrum or Agile, it was my opinion against someone else’s opinion.  While I was sure I was right, if I were honest about it I had no more reason to believe I was right than anyone else. Now, with the certification, I have someone else saying I know what I’m talking about.  And since I got 100% of the 30, rather difficult, questions right, I have a higher confidence that my understanding of the subject is correct.</p>
<h2 id="Fear"><a href="#Fear" class="headerlink" title="Fear"></a>Fear</h2><p>After I passed the test for the ScrumMaster certification, I realized that I am afraid of tests.  I used to say that all a certification did was show that you could pass a test.  But I’ve realized recently that that may have just been a cover because I didn’t want to take the test and fail. So, the reason I’m going after my MCSD is because I’m afraid of the test.  So, I fail.  So what?  At least in the process of studying for the test I’ll learn a few things.  The worse thing that can happen is that I don’t get the certification.  Ironically, from that point of view, not trying to get certified puts me in the same, if not worse, situation.  Not studying means no certification AND I haven’t learned anything in the process of studying for the exams.</p>
<h2 id="Birds-of-a-feather"><a href="#Birds-of-a-feather" class="headerlink" title="Birds of a feather"></a>Birds of a feather</h2><p>I find it interesting that I personally only know one person who has their  MCSD.  Could that be because I don’t have MY MCSD?  Could it be that the organizations where all of the people who have their MCSD only hire people who have their MCSD?  I know several really good programmers.  Only one has their MCSD.  The others could get it if they wanted to.  But are they stuck in their current position because they aren’t certified?  It’s worth finding out.</p>
<h2 id="The-test-isn’t-a-joke-anymore"><a href="#The-test-isn’t-a-joke-anymore" class="headerlink" title="The test isn’t a joke anymore"></a>The test isn’t a joke anymore</h2><p>For the longest time, my attitude about the test, as I mentioned above, was that it only showed that you could pass the test.  It didn’t really say you knew how to program or that you knew how to use the APIs.  I’m not the only one who felt this way.  Do a search online and you’ll find statements from years ago that say as much. While I’m sure it might be possible to pass the exams and still know nothing about how to program or how to use the APIs, it does seems that Microsoft is doing a much better job at ensuring that people who pass this certification can actually do the work as well.</p>
