        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/03/hand-039.jpg" alt="hand-039" title="hand-039">This past week I’ve been thinking a lot about changing habits and how much of our lives habits influence. To be clear, I would define a habit as something we have learned to do as an automated response to some trigger.  Something we no longer think about doing, but we just do because … well … because we’ve always done it that way. I have some bad habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat something sweet when I’m tired or bored.</li>
<li>How I react to particular situations</li>
<li>… others I’m not so willing to share publicly …  :)</li>
</ul>
<p>And some good habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up before 4:40am</li>
<li>Go to bed at 9:00pm</li>
<li>Write a blog post once a week</li>
<li>Watch <a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight</a> videos for 30 minutes every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>And some habits I’m trying to form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise every day</li>
<li>Take my vitamins</li>
<li>Work on my book for 30 minutes each day</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-I-Deal-With-Habits"><a href="#How-I-Deal-With-Habits" class="headerlink" title="How I Deal With Habits"></a>How I Deal With Habits</h2><p>Now, I’ve learned that the best way to conquer bad habits is to replace them with good habits.  So, for example, since I believe that fat is better than sugar, I might decide to eat cheese rather than cookies when I’m bored. I’ve also learned that if I can set an alarm, I’m more likely to do something.  In fact, my life is run from my calendar on my phone.  If you want me to do something for you, the best way to make sure I do it is to make sure I’ve scheduled it.  I’m kind of obsessive about keeping appointments, so this works well for me. The other thing that works well for me is doing something at the same time every day, or every week.  So, I write blog post, pay bills, do household chores and prepare for a Bible study that I run on Saturdays.  I watch <a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight</a> videos and work on the book that I’m writing first thing every morning.  I take my vitamins at the same time each day. It is the routine that helps maintain the habit.</p>
<h2 id="Start-Small"><a href="#Start-Small" class="headerlink" title="Start Small"></a>Start Small</h2><p>I often end up coaching people who want to start some new habit.  Maybe you’ve been reading my blog and you’ve been challenged to start implementing <a href="/categories/TDD/">Test Driven Development</a>.  What I find is that people want to start at the end.  So, let’s say you want to run 3 miles every day.  If you start out the first day and run three miles, I can pretty much assure you that you’ll give up right away.  No, what we need to do is something much smaller. I started exercising a couple of years ago, I realized that if exercising required me to go to a gym, I was never even going to get started.  The question I often ask people is, “What CAN you do?”  So I asked myself that question.  The answer came back, “I can do one exercise every hour and a half during the day. Then I started working outside of the house and the change in routine slowly eroded my ability to exercise.  So once again, I asked myself, “what CAN you do?”  I can do one exercise every morning.  Once I’ve established that habit, I plan on increasing to two exercises. So, if you want to start with TDD, probably the best way to start is to write a test.  One test.  Maybe commit to writing one test a day.  Think about it, if you are afraid that TDD won’t be accepted in your organization, who’s going to complain about one little test?  Or maybe better, just commit to a half hour of writing tests every day.  This allows you to get started without taking the huge time commitment learning TDD properly would take, which is probably what is keeping you from starting in the first place.  Start today.  Start now.  In a year, see if it hasn’t become how you develop code. What I’m still working on are ways that I react to situations.  These are a bit trickier to change because most of my responses are what people would called “learned responses.”  What I need to figure out is, 1) where did I learn these responses, 2) why did I learn them and 3) do the responses still make sense?</p>
<h2 id="Better-Than-Before"><a href="#Better-Than-Before" class="headerlink" title="Better Than Before"></a>Better Than Before</h2><p>A couple of resources caught my eye this week that I think you might be interested in if you are interested in killing bad habits or starting a new one. The first is a new book by Gretchen Rubin called, <a href="/betterThanBefore">Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Lives</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davmbusnetapp-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0385348614" alt>which will be out by the time this post goes live (I write these blog post well in advance of when you actually see them). What I’ve found particularly interesting is that Gretchen has developed a framework for how to determine how people respond to expectations, and <a href="//www.gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2014/03/quiz-are-you-an-upholder-a-questioner-a-rebel-or-an-obliger/">you can take a test to find out how you respond to expectations</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upholders: respond readily to outer and inner expectations.</li>
<li>Questioners: question all expectations; they’ll meet an expectation _if_ they think it makes sense; essentially, they make all expectations into inner expectations</li>
<li>Obligers: meet outer expectations, but struggle to meet expectations they impose on themselves</li>
<li>Rebels: resist all expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>Gretchen says, if you don’t want to take the test, you are probably a rebel, so don’t worry about it ;). Anyhow, I’m looking forward to reading the book when it comes out. I came out as an upholder, which is no real big surprise.  There are areas of my life that are HEAVILY influenced by what I think people expect of me, and I tend to question new expectations that are imposed on me. And yet, I still have trouble trying to implement new habits in my life.</p>
<h2 id="Coach-ME"><a href="#Coach-ME" class="headerlink" title="Coach ME"></a>Coach ME</h2><p>This brings me to my second resource.  I’ve known about this one for a while, but I’ve just recently really started using it. <a href="/coachme">Coach.me</a> is an app for iPhone and Android that allows you to use the power of community and accountability to help you establish your habits and achieve your goals.  If you want, or need, there is also  coaching that you can pay for if you want or need a little extra help. Right now, I’m just using the alarm and check-in feature.  Somehow being able to open the app and check the box that says I finished a particular activity is enough encouragement for me to not blow it off.  It probably helps that if I don’t check it off, I’ll forever have a hole in my calendar forever saying, “Yo!  you missed a day.” At some point, I may actually use one of the coaches.  I keep looking, but I haven’t found anyone that looks like someone I can relate to.  Or, maybe I just need to grow out of my 3 year old self that wants to do everything on my own.  That’s another area I’m working on.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/02/land-0148.jpg" alt="land-0148" title="land-0148"> As you start your journey down the road of Unit Testing you will discover that part of what makes code testable is this concept of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" title="Dependency injection">Dependency Injection</a>.  As you explore further, you will see people mentioning various Dependency Injection frameworks. You may naturally assume that to implement Dependency Injection, you will need to select an use a Dependency Injection framework. But, Dependency Injection has nothing to do with using a Dependency Injection framework.  The frameworks are there because: 1.  much of our existing code is code that has too many dependencies and the framework helps us break those dependencies without having to refactor too much of our code and 2. to give us a way to easily swap out one object for another when our code is structured in such a way as to not have dependencies at all. </p>
<h2 id="So-what-then-is-Dependency-Injection"><a href="#So-what-then-is-Dependency-Injection" class="headerlink" title="So, what then is Dependency Injection?"></a>So, what then is Dependency Injection?</h2><p>I once heard this maxim that explains it best,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classes should either create stuff, or do stuff, but no one class should do both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of our code looks something like this:</p>
<p>private static void ReceiveSAMLResponse(<br>    out SAMLResponse samlResponse,<br>    out String relayState)<br>{<br>    // Receive the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language" title="Security Assertion Markup Language">SAML</a> response over the<br>    //specified binding.<br>    XmlElement samlResponseXml;</p>
<pre><code>ServiceProvider.ReceiveSAMLResponseByHTTPPost(
    HttpContext.Current.Request, 
    out samlResponseXml, out relayState);
SAMLResponse resp = new SAMLResponse(samlResponseXml);
XmlElement samlAssertionElement = 
    resp.GetSignedAssertions()\[0\];

// Verify the response&apos;s signature.
XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();
//metadata file path (holds the description key).
doc.Load(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(&quot;~/SAML.xml&quot;));
XmlElement root = doc.DocumentElement;

if (!SAMLAssertionSignature.Verify(
    samlAssertionElement, ReadMetadata(root)))
{
    samlResponse = null;
    relayState = null;
    return;
}
// Deserialize the XML.
samlResponse = new SAMLResponse(samlResponseXml);
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>Yes, this is real code from a system I worked on.  The original code was written three or four years ago and this specific code is code I was given by another company.  I just used copy and paste inheritance to get it working in our code. That’s not to say I haven’t written cod that has just as many problems. There are several things that are wrong with this code, but for now all I want to focus on is the Dependency Injection issue. All this code is trying to do is to deserialize the encrypted samlResponse object that was posted to the login form.  At least this code isn’t in the login form!  It has that much going for it.</p>
<h2 id="But-here-are-places-where-it-is-dependent-on-too-much"><a href="#But-here-are-places-where-it-is-dependent-on-too-much" class="headerlink" title="But here are places where it is dependent on too much:"></a>But here are places where it is dependent on too much:</h2><ul>
<li>ServiceProvider is a static class and called directly.</li>
<li>ReceiveSAMLResponseByHTTPPost is dependent on the Request object that we retrieve from HttpContext.</li>
<li>I create a new SAMLResponse object right before I call GetSignedAssertions()</li>
<li>I create a new XmlDocument object so I can load the SAML.xml file</li>
<li>SAMLAssertionSignature is static and called directly</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, this method is one huge dependency mess.  And I’m very aware of the mess that it is in because the company we wrote this code for just recently switched providers.  As we tried to get this working, I had no way of testing this code in isolation without adding code directly into this method.  We got it working, but it didn’t have to be that hard.</p>
<h2 id="So-here’s-what-I’d-do-to-this-code"><a href="#So-here’s-what-I’d-do-to-this-code" class="headerlink" title="So, here’s what I’d do to this code."></a>So, here’s what I’d do to this code.</h2><ul>
<li>Since ServiceProvider and SAMLAssertionSignature are calls to a third party API, I would wrap them in a none static class that I can instantiate.</li>
<li>I would have the class that ultimately calls this method either pass in the dependent objects to the constructor, pass them in to the method that calls this, or set properties in the class.  This is what it means to inject dependencies.</li>
<li>I would look for some way to avoid creating a new SAMLResponse object.  I’m not looking at the API documentation, but it would be great if I could new up the object and call a method, or set a property to give it the samlResponseXml variable.  If I had to, I’d probably wrap SAMLResponse in another class so that I could gain this functionality.</li>
<li>Finally, I would make each of the dependent object based on an interface so that I could swap them out.  In the case of some of these classes, I may need to wrap them in another class that I have control over so that I can implement an interface.  For example, as things stand, I would not be able to create a fake request object because Request is a system class that does not implement an interface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h2><p>After making all of these changes, I would be able to create a test harness for this code, create fake versions of the objects, and verify that this method does what we intend for it do do. Where this would have been particularly helpful is over this last week when we were trying to get this all working with the new provider.  In that case, I could have faked out the request object with what they were sending us and run it through a debugger to figure out what wasn’t quite right.</p>
<h2 id="No-Dependency-Injection-Framework"><a href="#No-Dependency-Injection-Framework" class="headerlink" title="No Dependency Injection Framework"></a>No Dependency Injection Framework</h2><p>Finally, you’ll notice that no where in this code did I have to use a Dependency Injection framework to get this all working.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/02/ppl-kid-05.jpg" alt="ppl-kid-05" title="ppl-kid-05">Last week we looked at a few excuses developers give for not testing their code as they develop it (<a href="/excuses-for-not-testing/">Excuses For Not Testing</a>).  We finished that by mentioning that most of the code you write simply isn’t testable.  You can’t practice Test Driven Development on something that isn’t testable in the first place. And there, folks, is why Johnny can’t test.   </p>
<h2 id="But-it’s-not-Johnny’s-fault"><a href="#But-it’s-not-Johnny’s-fault" class="headerlink" title="But, it’s not Johnny’s fault."></a>But, it’s not Johnny’s fault.</h2><p>Think about what makes code testable.  At it’s core, testable code is loosely coupled.  But what do we mean by “loosely coupled”? Well, let’s start with the large picture.  Assuming you have a multi-layered architecture.  That is, you have your code broken out into View, Business Rules, and Data Access.  Raise your hand if your business rules access your view directly.  Would you be able to test your business rules without your view? At a finer level of detail.  How much of your code creates the objects it needs within the same class, or worse, the same method, that will need it?  Without using a Dependency Injection framework, could you swap out any objects your class uses?  Have you even heard the rule, “Classes should either create things or do things, but never both within the same class?”  If you did that, how much more testable would your code be? If you were to write a test for a method, how much setup work would you have to do?  If it is more than a few lines, your method is probably doing too much, either directly or indirectly.  You’ll need to find a way to make it do less. Maybe in future post, I’ll address some of these issues in code.  But for now, I just want to address the problem. Again, it isn’t Johnny’s fault that he doesn’t know this stuff.  Think about the code samples we tend to look at.</p>
<h2 id="When-is-the-last-time-you-saw-sample-code-that-was-testable"><a href="#When-is-the-last-time-you-saw-sample-code-that-was-testable" class="headerlink" title="When is the last time you saw sample code that was testable?"></a>When is the last time you saw sample code that was testable?</h2><p>Short rant here, but I’ve been working with EXTjs (version 4.x) for the last year and a half.  Sencha will tell you that this uses a MVC architecture.  But what they mean by “Controller” really functions more like a “ViewController.”  That is, the controller is tightly bound to the view that it handles events for.  The way they have things setup, you access View elements by getters that are automatically generated for you in the view. The problem with this is that you can’t really test the controller logic without bringing along the view. Sencha isn’t the only company who does this.  Most of the sample code for WebForms did the same kind of thing. Now, the reason this is an issue is that sample code is how most of the newer programmers are learning how to program. I heard recently that statistically, because of the growth of the industry, half of the programmers available have 5 years or less of experience.  I don’t know about you, but the first 5 years of my programming career, I was still figuring out how to program.  I wasn’t thinking about architecture issues and I certainly wasn’t thinking about formal testing.  From what I’ve seen of the new recruits, I don’t think they are either.  Shoot.  Some of the ones I’ve interacted with couldn’t code themselves out of a paper bag without help.</p>
<h2 id="And-so-what’s-the-conclusion-to-all-of-this"><a href="#And-so-what’s-the-conclusion-to-all-of-this" class="headerlink" title="And so, what’s the conclusion to all of this?"></a>And so, what’s the conclusion to all of this?</h2><p>I don’t know.  Maybe the first step is to admit that we have an issue here and that the issue is so much a management or time issue as it is an education and laziness issue.  That the code we generate shouldn’t assume that people will take the code and adapt it into testable code, but that we should write testable code as our sample code.  Maybe colleges should teach basic software architecture and TDD as part of the curriculum.  Maybe those of us who know better should just start testing and figure this all out well enough to explain it to others.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/02/ppl-kid-044.jpg" alt="ppl-kid-044" title="ppl-kid-044">As I started my own journey into unit testing, I slowly began to realize that it was really easy to come up with reasons to NOT test my code as I was writing it, even once I understood what that was supposed to look like. The reason I think most programmers don’t unit test code, once they understand what it is they are supposed to be doing is that they don’t feel like they have permission. To this I also answer, “How much permission do you need?” </p>
<h2 id="Do-you-really-need-permission"><a href="#Do-you-really-need-permission" class="headerlink" title="Do you really need permission?"></a>Do you really need permission?</h2><p>Do you ask for permission to compile and link the code? Do you ask for permission to write every line of code to make the system do what it should do? Do you ask for permission to run your code periodically to make sure it does what you had in mind when you wrote the code? Do you periodically add code that makes you feel good but is not directly related to the task at hand? (Admit it, I don’t think I know of any programmer who doesn’t.) Then why do we feel like we need permission to write unit test for our code?</p>
<h2 id="Are-you-convinced-that-you-need-test"><a href="#Are-you-convinced-that-you-need-test" class="headerlink" title="Are you convinced that you need test?"></a>Are you convinced that you need test?</h2><p>We don’t write test code because we aren’t convinced it is necessary to do the job we’ve been given. We complain that our managers don’t want us to write unit test. But the problem is that you asked for permission in the first place. And, by asking for permission, you’ve basically told your manager that unit testing is optional. Your manager has said “no” because he thinks YOU think it is optional.</p>
<h2 id="It’s-not-your-manager’s-job"><a href="#It’s-not-your-manager’s-job" class="headerlink" title="It’s not your manager’s job"></a>It’s not your manager’s job</h2><p>It isn’t his job to understand that not testing will produce technical debt. He’s not even interested in understanding what technical debt is. All he cares about is this. When will this project be done?  When you say it is done, will it work as expected or will it have a lot of bugs that need to be fixed yet? Most of the managers I’ve worked for in the past will accept whatever number I give them once they understand that when I deliver the software to them, it is going to work.  In fact, I’ve even gotten asked to do jobs BECAUSE my code tends to work more often than anyone else they know who could do the job. Now, I will admit, that in some cases there are places where you’ve been explicitly told to not create unit test. But even here I will assert it is because someone asked management the question.</p>
<h2 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h2><p>And so, we need to evaluate why it is we think creating unit test are optional. Probably because what we’ve been doing for so long seems to be working and, when we try to incorporate unit test, the process seems slower. And it is. Initially, writing unit test is slower just like writing using a new language or a new framework or anything else new is slower than what we know. But the ultimate efficiency that writing unit test as we code provides has been proven to more than offset the learning curve involved. There is one other valid reason for not testing and that is, we simply don’t know how.  This is almost as big of a reason as not believing it is worth while.  But, I think if we thought testing was really worth while, we’d start testing and figure it out as we went along. If you think about your career, I bet there are a lot of things you know now that you didn’t know when you started out.  The fact of the matter is, most of us learn on the job.  We start out with basic skills, but it is the day to day implementations that improve those skills.</p>

<p>Don’t let the good enough be the enemy of the perfect.  Your first set of test will be garbage.  As you stick with it, you’ll wonder what you were thinking when you wrote your first test.  But this should not deter you.  This is what happened when you first started coding.  Maybe it is still happening.  No worries.  It is the practice that will make you better able to write tests and better able to write code that is testable. And there is another reason we don’t test.  Most of the code you are currently writing simply isn’t testable.  But, that’s the subject for another post.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/02/image.png" alt="image" title="image">So everyone says that as a programmer, you should start a blog.  And yet, so few of us do.  Why is that? And so, I thought I’d spend time today giving you even more encouragement to start a blog, based on my own experience. </p>
<h2 id="A-blog-gives-me-a-place-to-file-what-I’ve-learned"><a href="#A-blog-gives-me-a-place-to-file-what-I’ve-learned" class="headerlink" title="A blog gives me a place to file what I’ve learned"></a>A blog gives me a place to file what I’ve learned</h2><p>Believe it or not, the best reason I can give you for starting a blog is so that you only have to learn something once. Have you ever worked on something, finally got it all figured out, and then a couple of weeks, or months, later needed to do that same exact task?  I sure have.  Or maybe you didn’t need that information, but you needed to explain it to a co-worker.  Either way, can you remember stuff you did weeks or months ago?  If you can, you must be super human, because I sure can’t. The best reason I have for maintaining this blog is that I can find information I’ve already learned because when I learn something new, I try to post it here.</p>
<h2 id="A-blog-will-help-you-learn-about-programming"><a href="#A-blog-will-help-you-learn-about-programming" class="headerlink" title="A blog will help you learn about programming"></a>A blog will help you learn about programming</h2><p>The more stuff I write about, the better I learn it.  So much of what I’ve written about in this blog is stuff I’ve learned along the way.  The act of writing it out for the world to see has clarified many of the ideas I thought I already knew.</p>
<h2 id="Blogging-Will-Teach-You-About-Yourself"><a href="#Blogging-Will-Teach-You-About-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Blogging Will Teach You About Yourself"></a>Blogging Will Teach You About Yourself</h2><p>But, blogging isn’t just about learning the topics you post about.  You learn something about yourself too.  How do you feel when someone leaves a critical comment?  Why?  What is your attitude toward all of the spam comments you get?  What if you end up just being flat out wrong about something you say?  How do you react then? Nope.  There’s no place better than a blog to have to deal with people and all that means.</p>
<h2 id="A-blog-will-also-teach-you-to-write"><a href="#A-blog-will-also-teach-you-to-write" class="headerlink" title="A blog will also teach you to write."></a>A blog will also teach you to write.</h2><p>Let’s face it, as a group, programmers don’t have very good written language skills.  We have trouble spelling.  Our grammar is all messed up.  We’re a mess. When I first started out, I had my daughter editing my blog.  That was helpful because she didn’t just edit my blog, but she told me what my most common problems are.  Hopefully, I’ve gotten better.</p>
<h2 id="A-blog-gets-you-exposure"><a href="#A-blog-gets-you-exposure" class="headerlink" title="A blog gets you exposure."></a>A blog gets you exposure.</h2><p>Because of this blog.  I’ve had several occasions where it has worked as an extended resume.  Several years ago, a guy who was reading the blog asked me to work on his web site.  I had another occasion where someone wanted my resume and I just pointed them to this blog.  Recently I updated my resume to include a link to my blog.  On a recent interview, I found that the people interviewing me had been to this blog and read some of the articles I’ve written.</p>
<h2 id="A-blog-can-make-you-money"><a href="#A-blog-can-make-you-money" class="headerlink" title="A blog can make you money"></a>A blog can make you money</h2><p>Ha!  Even the guys in this industry with really big blogs will tell you, that’s a joke.  At least if you measure the amount of money you can make from ad revenue on your blog.  The fact of the matter is, programmers are probably the least likely to click on ads of any group on the Internet. And yet, I’m sure this blog has indirectly increased the amount of money I’ve been able to charge my clients.</p>
<h2 id="Along-the-way-I’ve-also-learned"><a href="#Along-the-way-I’ve-also-learned" class="headerlink" title="Along the way I’ve also learned"></a>Along the way I’ve also learned</h2><p>While not necessarily directly related to blogging, along the way I’ve learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li>SEO</li>
<li>Ad Publishing</li>
<li>Traffic generating strategies</li>
<li>How to protect my site from being hacked.</li>
<li>Enough about PHP to modify  WordPress plugins</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>OK.  So maybe you’re thinking, “Dave, I’d love to start a blog, but I have no idea how to get started.” Well, it just so happens that <a href="//simpleprogrammer.com">John Sonmez</a> has a three week, “<a href="//devcareerboost.com/blog-course/">How to start blogging</a>” email course you can sign up for.  6 short lessons.

        <h1 id="…-Not-The-Destination"><a href="#…-Not-The-Destination" class="headerlink" title="… Not The Destination"></a>… Not The Destination</h1><p><img src="/uploads/2015/02/BeingAgile.png" alt="BeingAgile" title="BeingAgile">This post first started as I was discussing my post “<a href="/you-arent-doing-scrum-if/">You Aren’t Doing Scrum If …</a>” with a friend who had read the post and was worried that I might not fit in an organization that wasn’t doing all of Scrum.  I’ve since had other conversations and as I’ve reflected on the topic, I still stand by my original post, because there are some fundamental properties of Scrum that you have to implement in order to follow that methodology.  This is why I called the post “You Aren’t Doing <strong>Scrum</strong> If …” and not “You Aren’t Doing Agile If …”</p>
<h2 id="Agile-isn’t-Scrum"><a href="#Agile-isn’t-Scrum" class="headerlink" title="Agile isn’t Scrum"></a>Agile isn’t Scrum</h2><p>But Agile is different.  Agile isn’t a process. Agile is a mindset. So you can call yourself “Agile” without necessarily implementing any particular methodology because “Agile” isn’t about process.  Agile is about the collective state of mind of the team.  The organization as a whole.  Being Agile means that you are open to change.  That you embrace change.  Agile is about being flexible.  About knowing that you don’t know and that you don’t know what you don’t know.  Agile is about adapting.  Ultimately, it is about finding ways of being more productive. In fact, you could implement scrum precisely, which I doubt anyone really does, and not be Agile.</p>
<h2 id="Sacred-Cows"><a href="#Sacred-Cows" class="headerlink" title="Sacred Cows"></a>Sacred Cows</h2><p>In fact, my experience has been that as I try to move an organization along the sliding scale of  being more productive, I will, eventually, find a point of resistance.  The sacred cow of their process.  You can change whatever else you want, and yes, everything else you’ve suggested that we change has proven itself to be a better, more productive, less error prone way of doing what we do.  But, you can’t change our sacred cow. And so far every organization I’ve been in has some sacred cow that we either have to kill or we don’t progress further into being agile. And so we end up hearing comments from people in the industry like, “I don’t think I’ve been in any organization that has been TOTALLY ‘Agile.’” because every organization eventually runs up against some sacred cow on their road toward being agile.</p>
<h2 id="Leadership-Needs-To-Be-Agile"><a href="#Leadership-Needs-To-Be-Agile" class="headerlink" title="Leadership Needs To Be Agile"></a>Leadership Needs To Be Agile</h2><p>I know of another guy in the industry that postulates that the reason organizations fail as they try to implement agile is because agile is being forced on the organization.  That we need to create an environment where people have opted in to agile.  And to a certain extent, I think he’s right.  But, and I think this is a HUGE but, I think the larger problem is that the leadership has not embraced being agile and so you end up with developers trying to BE agile while the leadership is trying to be predictive.  Funny thing I’ve noticed about most employees, they’ll pretty much do whatever they think will keep the paychecks flowing.  So I don’t think we need opt-in at the worker bee level so much as we need opt-in at the leadership level.  Although I have seen resistance at both levels.</p>
<h2 id="Individuals-Need-To-Be-Agile"><a href="#Individuals-Need-To-Be-Agile" class="headerlink" title="Individuals Need To Be Agile"></a>Individuals Need To Be Agile</h2><p>Finally, while your organization may not be agile at all. It may not do Scrum, or Kanban.  It may resist all attempts to move in that direction.  This is not excuse for you to not be agile. You should ask yourself periodically, “What can I do that might be more productive than what I am currently doing?”  Because an organization can only be as agile as the people working in that organization and sometimes, all it really takes to move an organization closer to being agile is one individual who is willing to do what he or she does just a little more toward agile than they currently are. What sacred cows have you run into?  What are you doing to be more agile as an individual?  Leave a comment below.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/01/TddImpactsSoftwareArchitecture.png" alt="TDD Impacts Software Architecture" title="TddImpactsSoftwareArchitecture">I’ve had two incidents recently that have shown me how TDD impacts Software Architecture.  Both of these are with code I’m working on.</p>
<h2 id="What-Software-Architecture-Might-Do"><a href="#What-Software-Architecture-Might-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Software Architecture Might Do"></a>What Software Architecture Might Do</h2><p>Software architecture might specify how is put together at a very high level.  For example, software architecture might specify that we use a three tiered approach or an n-tiered approach.  This approach places our view code is at one level, our business rules are at another level, and our data access at yet a third level. Software architecture might specify that we use MVC where our business rules are in the model, and a controller communicates between the view and the model to get data between the two. It might specify MVVM. This would have the view model take the place of the controller and manage the state information for the view. Software architecture might also tell us we should use MVP, giving the presenter the role of the controller and managing state information for the view and communicating with the business rules. But none of these patterns tell us how to write maintainable code.  They only tell us about the general software architecture.  This is like having a sketch of a house without a wiring or plumbing plan.</p>
<h2 id="When-the-view-gets-in-the-way"><a href="#When-the-view-gets-in-the-way" class="headerlink" title="When the view gets in the way"></a>When the view gets in the way</h2><p>So, if you’ve been following this blog for a while, you may remember that I’m working with EXTjs.  Specifically, I’m working with EXTjs 4.2.  This has what Sencha calls an MVC architecture.  The problem is, what they refer to as the “Model” we would all recognize as a “Record” in a table, and their Controller is tightly coupled to their View.  That is, they call this MVC, but no one who understands what MVC is supposed to look like as a design pattern would recognize Sencha’s MVC as the real MVC design pattern. This makes the code incredibly hard to test.  The tendency is to write code that is highly dependent on the view.  The view is dependent on the DOM.  Rendering the view takes quite a bit of time.  So any test of your business rules end up taking an incredibly long time to test because they ultimately cause DOM manipulation to occur. It isn’t until you decide to borrow a bit of architecture from Angular that you realize that your business rules should be separate classes.  Angular has “Service Classes.” My Service classes are built specifically so they do not rely on anything else. By doing this, I was able to get two thirds of my code under test that run in about a second.  Prior to this, they took a half an hour. My next task was to get the view and my logic for enabling and disabling controls on the view more loosely coupled.  This was a bit more difficult because enabling and disabling controls is, naturally, a view thing. But again, taking a page from another framework, this time Knockout and Angular, I created a ViewModel.  My ViewModel holds the state of my view separate from the actual view.  When the state changes, it fires an event that actually changes the view, but this will allow me to test my enable/disable logic, along with other code in my system, without ever instantiating the view.  Under test, the events will fire and nothing will happen.</p>
<h2 id="Avoiding-Dependencies"><a href="#Avoiding-Dependencies" class="headerlink" title="Avoiding Dependencies"></a>Avoiding Dependencies</h2><p>Now the structure  of my code looks something like the following: View – ViewModel – EnableDisableController – EnableDisableService I could have put the EnableDisableService code in the EnableDisableController, and many people would, but what I’ve found is that if I do that, it would be nearly impossible to UNIT test my Enable/Disable logic.  Why?  Because I would be creating all of the objects I needed for the logic in the same class the logic is in. By breaking the logic code into it’s own class that takes the ViewModel as a construction parameter, I can create my own ViewModel that looks exactly like what I need it to look like so that I can test the logic with entirely known values. These are just two of the ways that code architecture is impacted by Test Driven Development.  I’m sure there are others. How have you found TDD helps improve your software architecture?  Leave me a comment below.  </p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/01/YouArentDoingScrumIf.png" alt="You Aren&#39;t Doing Scrum If..." title="YouArentDoingScrumIf">I’ve been frustrated lately by the flippant use of the words “Scrum” and “Agile” in our industry.  They’ve officially made it to the point of “buzzwords that mean nothing” that get slapped onto job requirements like the typical requirements we’ve all seen. </p>
<ul>
<li>Must be able to communicate</li>
<li>Must be able to work in a team environment</li>
<li>Must be able to work under pressure</li>
<li>Must be able to work in an Agile environment</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s really funny is when I see</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet tight deadline</li>
<li>Expert in Agile</li>
</ul>
<p>together in the same job request.</p>
<h2 id="Really-Do-you-know-what-you’re-saying"><a href="#Really-Do-you-know-what-you’re-saying" class="headerlink" title="Really?  Do you know what you’re saying?!"></a>Really?  Do you know what you’re saying?!</h2><p>Many people even use the words “Agile” and “Scrum” interchangeably.  Most because they really do think they are the same thing. I’m finding that what most people mean when they use these words is, either, “we work really fast”, “we work iteratively”, or “we don’t really have a plan.”</p>
<h2 id="So-the-first-thing-we-need-to-clarify-is-what-is-Scrum-and-what-is-Agile"><a href="#So-the-first-thing-we-need-to-clarify-is-what-is-Scrum-and-what-is-Agile" class="headerlink" title="So, the first thing we need to clarify is, what is Scrum and what is Agile."></a>So, the first thing we need to clarify is, what is Scrum and what is Agile.</h2><p>Agile is a set of values.  It is what we believe about software development specifically and, I would argue, also impacts how we view life.  You might have other beliefs that live on top of Agile, but these beliefs will have an impact on how you manage the software development process specifically and your organization in general. Check out the <a href="//www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>.  This is what it means to be Agile. In contrast to this, Scrum is a methodology that helps an organization BE agile. Now here is where things get tricky for some people.  They read in the manifesto that we should value “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools” and think that they can make Scrum be whatever they want it to be because, they would say, “we don’t value processes and tools”. But the Agile Manifesto never says that.  It says we value individuals and interactions MORE than, not INSTEAD of, processes and tools. So, yes, you can adapt and modify Scrum to fit your situation.  You may need to.  But there are some specific elements of Scrum that you simply can’t ignore because to do so would mean either that you are no longer Agile or you are not implementing Scrum.</p>
<h2 id="And-so-you-aren’t-doing-Scrum-if"><a href="#And-so-you-aren’t-doing-Scrum-if" class="headerlink" title="And so, you aren’t doing Scrum if:"></a>And so, you aren’t doing Scrum if:</h2><h4 id="You-have-deadlines-especially-if-you-have-“tight-deadlines”"><a href="#You-have-deadlines-especially-if-you-have-“tight-deadlines”" class="headerlink" title="You have deadlines, especially if you have “tight deadlines”"></a>You have deadlines, especially if you have “tight deadlines”</h4><p>“Now wait a minute,” you say, “I heard that Scrum has these things called ‘Sprints’ that are a fixed length.  Don’t those qualify as ‘deadlines?’” Well, yes and no.  You see, I don’t think what Scrum treats as a “deadline” is what most managers mean by “deadline.” At the end of the day you’ll get to the end of the Sprint and you’ll show what you’ve got.  The GOAL is to have a complete set of code that you wouldn’t be embarrassed to show to another programmer.  You should have only selected what could reasonably get done in the timeframe of a sprint so that all that needs to be done to complete the task could get done. One of the confusions is that somewhere along the line we were told that at the end of each sprint we should have a “shippable unit of software” and we’ve confused that with “a viably marketable product”  All that shippable means is, “if the customer thinks what you’ve completed so far is something they can use, you would not respond with, ‘but it still needs…’” This ties in with the other way you know you aren’t doing Scrum</p>
<h4 id="You-aren’t-doing-scrum-if-you-don’t-have-a-“definition-of-done-”"><a href="#You-aren’t-doing-scrum-if-you-don’t-have-a-“definition-of-done-”" class="headerlink" title="You aren’t doing scrum if you don’t have a “definition of done.”"></a>You aren’t doing scrum if you don’t have a “definition of done.”</h4><p>And once again, there is confusion.  To most people, the “definition of done” is “I can ship this code.”  But that may not be appropriate.  You’re definition of done during your first sprint may be “a set of stories that begin to describe the application we are trying to build.”  As you are learning scrum, you’re definition of done may be as simple as, “all of the code we’ve written so far have Unit Test, appropriate documentation, and we’ve learned something of how long a story point will take our team.” Definition of done doesn’t always have to mean “I’ve written code I can ship.”</p>
<h4 id="You-aren’t-doing-Scrum-if-you-HAVE-to-work-more-than-40-hours-a-week"><a href="#You-aren’t-doing-Scrum-if-you-HAVE-to-work-more-than-40-hours-a-week" class="headerlink" title="You aren’t doing Scrum if you HAVE to work more than 40 hours a week."></a>You aren’t doing Scrum if you HAVE to work more than 40 hours a week.</h4><p>One of the benefits of Scrum is that it allows us to pace ourselves.  We no longer scrabble to get stuff done.  We work consistently toward the goal.  But it isn’t a race. I have a rule.  If I tell you something will be done by a set time, I’ll bust my butt to make that happen.  If you tell me when it will be done, good luck with that. Of course, even when I tell someone when something will be done, I pad the estimate with enough hours that I never work more than 45 hours a week.  There is one day, in the 26 years I’ve been doing this where I worked longer than 12 hours. In fact, I had one manager who called me into his office and asked me to come in on Saturdays.  I was already working 10 hour days 5 days a week!  Talk about getting blood out of a turnip! I looked him straight in the eye and said, “I have 50 hours a week in me.  I’d prefer to give them to you Monday through Friday.  But if you want me to come in on Saturday, I can do that, but you are still only going to get 50 hours a week.” Needless to say, I never came in on Saturday.</p>
<h2 id="I-could-go-on…"><a href="#I-could-go-on…" class="headerlink" title="I could go on…"></a>I could go on…</h2><p>I could go on, but these are the really big ones. So, what do you think?  What examples do you have of places that say they are Agile/Scrum environments but don’t have a clue what that means? Leave a comment below.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/01/IsJavaScriptBroken.png" alt="IsJavaScriptBroken" title="IsJavaScriptBroken">I read a post this week that was essentially a rant on the way JavaScript handles concatenation.  It states that JavaScript is in someway “broken” (without actually using that word) because JavaScript does not work the way this person expected it to.</p>
<h2 id="Here-is-a-rebuttal"><a href="#Here-is-a-rebuttal" class="headerlink" title="Here is a rebuttal."></a>Here is a rebuttal.</h2><p>JavaScript works the way JavaScript was designed to work, and the way many other languages work.  The fact that it does not have the Do_what_I_was_thinking() function is a separate issue (which so far as I know, no language has yet). The main statement I have to take issue with is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The + operator is known to most of us as a symbol for addition, so it does not make sense to use it in [the instance where we want to concatenate strings]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh?  Really? How about C++, C#, Java and the various flavors of VB?  Each of these languages have an overloaded + operator that performs concatenation. Then as you read through the article you discover that the REAL issue is the fact that you can’t concatenate numbers by either using the concat() method or by using the + because numbers are … well … numbers. But here again I have to point to the fact that JavaScript works similar to other languages that are not type-safe. For example VBScript, VB6 using variants and probably others have this same basic issue.  If you are going to use the plus operator for concatenation and for math, you have to have rules about when it will be used for each.  Since numbers are typically ADDED together and strings are typically CONCATENATED, it make sense the the default behavior would be for those behaviors to be primary in those instances.  In the case where you want to concatenate two numbers, the obvious choice would be to somehow force them to be strings instead of numbers.  And in all of the languages I know of where this is needed, putting an empty string in the chain of numbers you want to concatenate is how you achieve this behavior. What is humorous is that this person went  through a long series of commands to illustrate how painful it is to actually coerce numbers into being concatenated and then shows a “simple” method they’ve created to create a concat() method for numbers that essentially amounts to what anyone who knows JavaScript well would do inline:</p>
<p>var newValue = “” + number + number</p>
<p>So, no JavaScript isn’t broken any more than any other language.  It has a defined set of rules that it follows.  Saying that it is broken is like saying English is broken.  And frankly, I could make a much stronger case for English being broken than I could for any programming language being broken including JavaScript.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/01/SeleniumGridSetup.png" alt="SeleniumGridSetup" title="SeleniumGridSetup">My experience with setting up Selenium Grid was frustrated by the lack of information available about exactly what I needed to do to get this working. I’ve actually had this working for a while now and I’ve set it up, or helped others set it up now, several times.  So, I guess it is time to write a post about it so I can just send people here when I need to explain the setup. Note, the following discussion already assumes you know something about how to use Selenium without the Grid so there won’t be a lot of code here other than what is need to get the Grid up and running so you can run your test on it.  First, we need to discuss the basic configuration of a Selenium Grid setup.  There are two main parts.  A Selenium Hub, and Selenium Nodes.  The Hub is what your test code will talk to.  Think of it as the traffic cop to all of the browsers you want to test. The Selenium Nodes register themselves with the Hub and tell the Hub what browsers they support. You will only have one Hub, but you might have multiple nodes.  In my basic configuration, I have two nodes running on the same computer as my Hub that support the current version of FireFox and the current version of IE, since those are the only browsers that are officially supported by the organization I am working at.  (These are private sites, and yes, everyone knows Chrome is better than either of those, but you know how fast policies change in large organizations.) OK, so much for theory, here is how to setup your system. First, on the computers that you will be running the Hub and the Nodes on, create a directory to hold all of the files you will need. I generally put all of my files in c:\selenium.  It makes them really easy to find. Since the Selenium Grid runs using Java, make sure you have that installed on the computers you need to run the Hub and Nodes on. OK.  Enough setup.  Now for the actually Selenium Grid files you are going to need. Download the selenium server JAR file.  There is a link to it under the “Selenium Server” section of this page: <a href="//www.seleniumhq.org/download/" title="http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/">http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/</a>.  The current file name is “selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar”.  Place the file in the selenium directories you created.  This is the jar file you will run for both the Hub and the Nodes so you’ll need this on every computer you plan to run the Grid on. For the various browsers you want to run on that need a separate driver, like IE, you’ll also want to download and install the appropriate driver server from that same page and place the EXE on the computer that you plan to run that browser on. OK.  So now to get this running. You’ll want to put the following in a cmd file and place the cmd file in the Selenium directory with all the other stuff on your Hub computer:</p>
<p>“{path to your java directory}\java.exe” -jar<br>    selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar -role hub</p>
<p>This will run the Hub on port 4444.  This is all you need to do.  You should end up with a console window that looks like this: <img src="/uploads/2015/01/Hub1.png" alt="Hub" title="Hub"> The next script you will need to create is the script that will run the node.  Since I only need FireFox and IE11, I run this on the same computer.  I’ll first provide you with that script and then explain it so that you can adapt it for your own situation. Here’s the script:</p>
<p>“{path to your java directory}\java.exe” -jar<br>    selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar -role<br>    node -hub <a href="http://localhost:4444/grid/register/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:4444/grid/register/</a> -browser<br>    browserName=firefox,maxInstances=5,platform=WINDOWS -browser<br>    browserName=”internet explorer”,version=11,maxInstances=5,<br>    platform=WINDOWS,<br>    -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=c:\Selenium\IEDriverServer.exe</p>
<p>The first thing you should note is that we’ve specified the role as “node” with the –role node flag. Since we are a Node, we also have to tell the node where the Hub is so that it can register itself with the Hub.  That is what the –hub <a href="http://localhost:4444/grid/register/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:4444/grid/register/</a> parameter is for.  If you are placing a node on a computer other than the same computer as the Hub, you will obviously need to change the  URL to point back to the Hub computer instead  of localhost. Everything past this point tells the Hub what browsers are supported on this Node.  So, you’ll notice we have two –browser parameters.  One for FireFox and one for IE.  The browser parameter is all one long string.  To specify IE, you’ll want to specify “internet explorer”.  Note the quote marks and the space.  It took me a while to figure this part out.  The next browser parameter is maxInstances and it tells the Hub how many instances of the browser can run on this node.  I hardly ever have more than one running at a time, but specifying 5 allows me to run test even if something goes wrong.  If something does go wrong, the instance will eventually close itself. The next parameter, platform, tells the Hub what platform we are running on.  You may not need  this if all of your platforms are the same.  But if you are running FireFox on Mac, Windows, and Linux, you’ll want to specify this. Since I only ever test the most recent version of FireFox, I haven’t specified a version for FireFox, but for IE, there was a time when I was testing IE11 and IE8.  So, I have the version, 11, specified here for IE to tell the hub that this node runs IE11. The final parameter it took me quite a while to figure out was the –Dwebdriver.ie.driver.  This is how you tell the Node where the IEDriverServer lives.  I imagine there is a similar parameter for the other drivers as well. When you run this code, it will look something like this: <img src="/uploads/2015/01/Node1.png" alt="Node" title="Node"> If you need the –Dwebdriver config information for another browser, you can google for Dwebdriver. and you should be able to find it.  Since the only officially supported Selenium driver is the IE driver, the config for the others may depend on the vendor who supplied the driver.  Oh, the joys of open source. And now, of course, to use all of this, you’ll need to specify in your code that you want to use the Grid drivers and through that, you’ll specify what browser you want the code to run on.</p>
<p>var driver = new RemoteWebdriver(<br>    new Uri(“http://{pathToHub}:4444/wd/hub”),<br>    DesiredCapabilities.Firefox());</p>
<p>Or</p>

<p>Finally, someone might say, “so why go to all this trouble when you could just use something like SauceLabs?” Well, even if you have SauceLabs setup for your continuous integration, I think you’ll still need something setup while you are creating your tests.  Yes, you could run without the grid while you are writing your test and use the grid as part of your continuous integration process, but my experience is that the grid works just enough differently that you are really better off creating your test using the grid. In my current situation, I have a virtual machine setup to run my test.</p>
