        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> For the last two years, about 99% of the work I’ve been doing has been JavaScript programming using EXTjs.  The problems I’ve encountered along the way are primarily related to testing.  Writing unit test using the “MVC Framework” out of the box is nearly impossible, but I did eventually put together an architecture that allows me to do that.  I may blog about that in the future. Today, what I want to offer is how I overcame various hurdles related to testing EXTjs with Selenium.  The first problem nearly everyone encounters when they first use EXTjs is that the views that are created are created dynamically.  If you use the recommended itemId to uniquely identify the elements on the page, you will be left with IDs that are dynamically generated and inconsistent.  That is, just because the ID has one value today doesn’t mean it will have the same value tomorrow.  And since the controls are dynamically created based on what browser is running, XPATH queries aren’t a good solution either.</p>
<h2 id="Custom-FindsBy-attribute"><a href="#Custom-FindsBy-attribute" class="headerlink" title="Custom FindsBy attribute"></a>Custom FindsBy attribute</h2><p>Now, you could solve this problem by creating a different Page Object for each browser and then you’d be able to use XPATH statements to go after the elements.  But, what if you could go after the itemIds directly?  By the Selenium APIs let you create your own selectors.  So, instead of writing your element properties like this:</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using=”someId”)]<br>private IWebElement SomeId{get; [UsedImplicitly]set;}</p>
<p>  You could do something like:</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Custom,<br>    CustomFinderType = typeof(ExtByComponentQuery),<br>    Using = “#someId”)]<br>private IWebElement SomeId{get; [UsedImplicitly]set;}</p>
<p>One of the side effects of using this extension is that you can now find any element using any valid EXTjs selector. So, you are probably wondering what the code looks like to get this all working.  Well here you go:</p>
<p>using System;<br>using System.Collections.Generic;<br>using System.Collections.ObjectModel;<br>using System.Linq;<br>using System.Threading;<br>using OpenQA.Selenium;<br>using OpenQA.Selenium.Internal;</p>
<p>namespace ENT.Supporting<br>{<br>    public class ExtByComponentQuery : By<br>    {<br>        private readonly string _locator;<br>        public ExtByComponentQuery(string locator)<br>        {<br>            _locator = locator;<br>        }</p>
<pre><code>public static ExtByComponentQuery Query(string locator)
{
    if (locator == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(&quot;locator&quot;, 
            @&quot;Cannot find elements when name locator is null.&quot;);
    return new ExtByComponentQuery(locator);
}

public override IWebElement FindElement(ISearchContext context)
{
    var elements = FindElements(context);
    if (elements != null &amp;&amp; elements.Count &gt; 0)
        return elements.First();
    Console.WriteLine(@&quot;returning null from FindElement&quot;);
    return null;
}

public override ReadOnlyCollection&lt;IWebElement&gt; FindElements(ISearchContext context)
{
    var script = string.Format(
</code></pre><p>@”var r= Ext.ComponentQuery.query(‘{0}’);<br>var rarray = [];<br>for(e = 0;e &lt; r.length;e++)<br>{ {<br>    if(r[e].getEl() !== undefined)<br>        rarray.push(r[e].getEl().dom);<br>}}<br>return rarray;”,_locator.Replace(“‘“,”\\’”));<br>            var javaScriptExecutor = context as IJavaScriptExecutor ??<br>                                     ((IWrapsDriver)context).WrappedDriver as IJavaScriptExecutor;<br>            if (javaScriptExecutor == null) return null;<br>            object scriptReturn = null;<br>            for (var i = 0; i &lt; 120 &amp;&amp; scriptReturn == null; i++)<br>            {<br>                if ( i &gt; 0) Thread.Sleep(1000);<br>                scriptReturn = javaScriptExecutor.ExecuteScript(script);<br>            }<br>            return scriptReturn == null ? null : new ReadOnlyCollection<iwebelement>((IList<iwebelement>)scriptReturn);<br>        }<br>    }<br>}</iwebelement></iwebelement></p>
<p>The constructor gets passed the selector string that is passed with the Using parameter in the attribute.  The FindElements() finds all of the elements that match the selector.  The FindElement() returns the first of all that it found. You can either use this code as part of the FindsBy attribute or you can use it stand alone by calling the static Query method. You’ll see that the bulk of the functionality is just the same JavaScript code you would normally write in EXTjs.</p>
<h2 id="Get-an-element’s-Value"><a href="#Get-an-element’s-Value" class="headerlink" title="Get an element’s Value"></a>Get an element’s Value</h2><p>One of the other problems you are likely to run into is retrieving the current value of an element.  This is because many of the controls that EXT provides to us do not use the INPUT item’s value to keep track of the value.  So, for this, and other similar scenarios, I wrote an extension method.</p>
<p>public static string GetExtValue(this IWebElement element)<br>{<br>    IWebElement realElement = null;<br>    if (element as IWrapsDriver == null)<br>    {<br>        var e = element as IWrapsElement;<br>        if (e != null) realElement = e.WrappedElement;<br>    }<br>    else<br>    {<br>         realElement = element;<br>    }</p>
<pre><code>if (realElement == null) return null;

var wrapsDriver = (IWrapsDriver)realElement;
var id = realElement.GetAttribute(&quot;id&quot;);
var driver = wrapsDriver.WrappedDriver;
var val = ((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(
    @&quot;return Ext.getCmp(arguments\[0\]).getRawValue();&quot;,
    id);
if (val == null)
{
    return string.Empty;
}
return val.ToString();
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>What you’ll want to pay attention to here is the code at the top. The if(element as IWrapsDriver) stuff is testing to see if we have the real element or if we have a proxy to the element that was created by the FindsBy attribute.  If the element is of type IWrapsDriver, we have the proxy and so need to go grab the real element before we continue.  Once we are sure we are working with a real element, we can use JavaScript to grab the raw value from EXTjs.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Modifications"><a href="#Other-Modifications" class="headerlink" title="Other Modifications"></a>Other Modifications</h2><p>I found that there were other modifications that I needed to make.  So I’ve also created extension methods that select items from dropdown list, Click radio buttons and checkboxes until they are actually selected (or actually unselected).  I found that they don’t always select or unselect on the first click for some reason.  Also, if your code is enabling and disabling stuff and you want to check for that, you’ll need to write some extensions to handle that because EXT uses a mask to disable.  The best way of determining if something is enabled or disabled is by writing JavaScript to ask EXT if it is enabled or disabled.  There are other things I’ve written that are somewhat project specific.  But if you run into a problem, your best bet is to create an extension method to go after EXT code directly.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I generally hate using the framework I’m using to test my code from EXTjs.  And whenever possible, I’ll look for a way to go after the elements using plain old selectors and the built in Selenium code.  But that isn’t always practical in this case.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> I had this thought this past week that we tend to believe that if we are in motion, we are accomplishing something.  That being busy somehow equals being productive.  And then I started thinking about how this is almost universal.  It doesn’t just impact how we program, which I’ll get to eventually, but it impacts all of our life.</p>
<h2 id="Let-Me-Illustrate"><a href="#Let-Me-Illustrate" class="headerlink" title="Let Me Illustrate"></a>Let Me Illustrate</h2><p>Have you ever driven to some location and had your favorite GPS system route you multiple ways?  How many of you take the route that is, according to your GPS, longer, just because the roads are 65mph instead of 45mph?  Or an even better example.  You hit a traffic jam and, even though ever indication is that you’ll be out of the traffic in a few minutes, you take an alternate route simply because the traffic is moving on that other road.  In both cases you probably know that you won’t get to your destination any faster, in fact you may get to your destination slower, but you still opt to take the moving route instead of the one that isn’t moving or is moving relatively slowly.  I’ve even heard people say… shoot I’ve even said… “I want to take this route because it moves faster.”  I like FEELING like I’m getting to my destination faster even if the reality is that I’m not. And then there is the issue of your job.  How many of you have to look busy for your peers to think that you ARE busy?  But as programmers, how true is that?  Unless you do some kind of unskilled labor, I doubt it is true of most people who work.  And yet, because we are all paid by the hour (yes, even those of you who are salaried are still trading hours for dollars) there is a perception that, somehow, if we are not in motion, we are not really working.  But is that true? I remember hearing a story about a programmer who spent half his day “staring at the ceiling” who was twice as productive as any of his peers.  Why is that?  Because he spent half his day thinking about the problem before he ever started writing a line of code. I remember back in the day when I was coding on 8088 computers, a compile and link cycle could take up to 10 minutes.  Because I recompile and test every time I’m made a runnable change, I had a lot of 10 minute breaks.  I used this time to think about the problem I was working on.  This was not intentional, it just happened naturally.  I think it made me more productive than if I were just churning code all day long at the speed our computers work today. And then there is this side project I’m working on.  I tend to work on it a half hour at a time as I have time.  Between my main gig that takes up 40 hours a week, and some side gigs that I have, I have a very small amount of time to work on this project.  Some days I don’t work on it simply because I’m too tired.  But sometimes, even when I’m not sitting in front of my computer, I’ll sit on my sofa doing nothing and think about the project.  It is in those times that I figure out where I want to take the project next, or how to solve a problem I’ve run into.  That time thinking, even though there is no motion, has made the resulting code that much better.</p>
<h2 id="The-Fallacy-of-Motion-and-Testing"><a href="#The-Fallacy-of-Motion-and-Testing" class="headerlink" title="The Fallacy of Motion and Testing"></a>The Fallacy of Motion and Testing</h2><p>I’m sure you saw this coming, but one has to ask, is it the fallacy of motion that prevents us from testing our code? At my main gig, I have to admit, I’m bored.  There are a lot of reasons for this.  But one of them is that I spend a lot of time waiting for integrations tests to run to verify that my code is still working.  To be clear, I have way more unit test than integration test at this point.  But with the changes I’m currently making to the system, I’m more likely to find issues via the integration tests than I am from the unit tests. Compare this to a project I’m working on for another client where I’m primarily writing new code.  I’m a lot less bored.  The day zips by.  I FEEL more productive. And yet, the degree of certainty I have that the code I wrote for my main gig works as I designed it to work is a lot higher than the code I’m currently writing because I have more tests. This past week those tests actually showed me that my change wasn’t working entirely the way I wanted it to.  I probably would not have found it any other way.  I’m not even sure the people testing my code would have found it.  They aren’t those kind of testers.  And so I’ve proven to myself one more time that testing, while it feels slower, really is not just the right thing to do, but ultimately the faster thing to do. Think about what would have happened if I didn’t have these tests in place.  I would have released the code, eventually the bug would have revealed itself, and I would be left scrambling to fix the bug.  As it is, I was able to fix the bug in a somewhat leisurely manner because I found it early. And yet, I don’t FEEL productive.  As much as I’m convinced that Test Driven Development is the right way to go, I still struggle with this Fallacy of Motion.</p>
<h2 id="We-Don’t-Have-Time-to-Test"><a href="#We-Don’t-Have-Time-to-Test" class="headerlink" title="We Don’t Have Time to Test"></a>We Don’t Have Time to Test</h2><p>I heard this again this past week.  “When you are working on a project with a tight deadline, you can’t always test because you don’t have enough time.” What?! Is this the Fallacy of Motion at work again? I would argue that it is precisely BECAUSE you are working under a tight deadline that you NEED to write test. Think about this, you have this tight deadline.  Great.  So you are not going to think clearly.  You are going to rush.  You will write incomplete code.  Your methods won’t verify input parameters.  You’ll have null pointer exceptions.  Your code will do what it is supposed to do, but will it not do what it shouldn’t do?  How will you know?  And who is going to catch the bug? Well we know the answer to that last question.  The people using your code will catch the bug.  This will make you look like an idiot.  You are because it is something that should have been caught.  It will also mean that you’ll need to track down the problem, fix the problem, and re-deploy the software.  And this is faster?  Faster than what?! Of course, “We don’t have time to do it right, but we always have time to do it over.”</p>
<h2 id="Slow-and-Steady"><a href="#Slow-and-Steady" class="headerlink" title="Slow and Steady"></a>Slow and Steady</h2><p>So, slow down.  Do things right.  Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare.  The race doesn’t always go to the fastest but the one who is steady and persistent.  The one who doesn’t cut corners.  The one who consistently produces solid code.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/ppl-kid-044.jpg" alt="ppl-kid-044" title="ppl-kid-044"> This probably doesn’t happen all that often, but this last week I came across the need to know which browser I was running my selenium test against.  I figured that buried deep in the object structure of Selenium, there MUST be a way of finding out what browser I was currently running.  As it turns out, I was right.  The situation that caused this requirement is that the place where I’m currently writing most of my code is upgrading all of the Firefox browsers.  I was asked to make sure the code we were running still works with the new browser.  When I did, I found that some of my tests broke even though the test itself still succeeds when it is run manually.  In fact, they only broke when running against this new version of Firefox. Now to be clear, this isn’t really a Firefox problem.  In fact, the new version of Firefox runs my test the way I would expect.  It is the current version of IE and the older version of Firefox that we were running in combination with EXTjs 4.2 that was a problem.  So, now I’m in a situation where I need to run my work around for everything except for this new version of Firefox. You see, we have several dropdown list.  To select an item from the list, I cursor down until the correct item is found.  My old implementation actually needed to cursor down twice.  The first time made the list display and kept the current item selected.  The second down arrow selected the next item.  The tab key keeps that item as the selected one.  The new version of Firefox only requires one down arrow and a tab to do the same thing. Since we have multiple dropdowns that behave the same way, I made this code an extension method, so I only have to do it once.  The other thing I’m doing that makes this work is that I’m proxying the elements using the FindsBy attribute.</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using = “someIdHere”), CacheLookup]<br>private IWebElement SomePropertyName<br>    { get; [UsedImplicitly] set; }</p>
<p>  Under the hood this creates a proxy to the real element.  What we need access to is the Driver object that this element is using to get at the element on the browser.  I do that by going after the element’s WrappedDriver property.  In most code you’ll see this cast to an IWrapsDriver interface.  But it is actually pointing to a RemoteWebDriver object.  If we cast the type to that, we can then go after the Capabilities object which will give us access to the BrowserName. And so, my resulting code looks something like this:</p>
<p>var keyDown = Keys.Down + Keys.Down;<br>var wrapsDriver = ((IWrapsDriver)(element)).WrappedDriver;<br>if (wrapsDriver != null)<br>{<br>    if (wrapsDriver.GetType() == typeof(RemoteWebDriver) &amp;&amp;<br>        ((RemoteWebDriver)wrapsDriver)<br>        .Capabilities.BrowserName ==  “firefox”)<br>     {<br>        keyDown = Keys.Down;<br>     }<br>}</p>
<p>Which allows me to use the keyDown variable where ever I need to key down to select an item from the list. The element variable above represents the proxy element created by the FindsBy attribute.  The code is in the extension method that I mentioned previously, so it is actually the parameter that got passed into the extension method.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> Over the past ten years, I’ve successfully implemented various types of screen scraping in order to provide data to my clients.  Most of these implementations have involved accessing HTML and parsing out the data we needed for the web application. My latest implementation of this made use of the <a href="//htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/">HTML Agility Pack</a> and managed to incorporate the e-Labels For Education site into the Labels For Education site.  (No links, because the e-Labels program is being phased out.) Recently, I’ve been spending a lot of times on some site doing the same thing over and over again.  But most of the sites I visit now implement some kind of AJAX so that doing a simple web request to a page without also loading and parsing the JavaScript ends up giving me a page with no useful data at all.  Unlike the work I’ve done in the past where this was sufficient. This, combined with my recent work implementing Jasmine unit test for JavaScript and running them in the PhantomJS headless browser has had me thinking, wouldn’t it be great if I could do similar kinds of screen scraping, or even browser automation, but use something like an embedded version of PhantomJS to get the work done. Well, do a search for “embedded PhantomJS for .NET” or something similar and you’ll find that that isn’t possible.  At least not yet. But there is a viable alternative.  Actually there are a couple of viable alternative.  But they all end up using the Google Chromium browser API.  The implementation I ended up using is <a href="//github.com/cefsharp">CefSharp</a>.  Mostly because this is what is available from NuGet. What follows are some of the tricks I learned along the way.</p>
<h2 id="Installing-Chromium"><a href="#Installing-Chromium" class="headerlink" title="Installing Chromium"></a>Installing Chromium</h2><p>The first thing you’ll need to do once you have a project started, is that you’ll need to install the Chromium DLLs.  In the NuGet package manager, do a search for CefSharp.  This will bring up a list of plugins, you’ll want to install CefSharp.OffScreen and CefSharp.Common (I’m assuming you want to do off-screen automation here.)  The version I am working with is version 39. What I found difficult to figure out next was how to actually use the library.</p>
<h2 id="Get-It-Initialized"><a href="#Get-It-Initialized" class="headerlink" title="Get It Initialized"></a>Get It Initialized</h2><p>You’ll want to initialize the library before you use it.  The following lines will do that.  I just put this as early in my code as possible.</p>
<p>var settings = new CefSettings<br>    {LogSeverity = LogSeverity.Verbose};<br>settings.CefCommandLineArgs.Add(“no-proxy-server”, “1”);</p>
<p>Cef.OnContextInitialized = ()<br>    => Cef.SetCookiePath(“cookies”, true);</p>
<p>if (!Cef.Initialize(settings, shutdownOnProcessExit: false,<br>    performDependencyCheck: true))<br>{<br>     throw new Exception(“Unable to Initialize Cef”);<br>}</p>
<p>If you want to use a proxy server, you’ll need to look up the documentation for how to set the proxy server. The Cef.SetCookiePath sets the location of your cookie file.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-The-Browser-“Window”"><a href="#Creating-The-Browser-“Window”" class="headerlink" title="Creating The Browser “Window”"></a>Creating The Browser “Window”</h2><p>Now that you have this all set, you can use the ChromiumWebBrowser class to create a browser window.  Since the browser is disposable, you’ll want to either wrap the code in a using() statement or you’ll want to make sure you dispose of the browser object when you are done. You’ll want to set a few things on the browser object next.</p>
<p>browser.BrowserSettings<br>    .FileAccessFromFileUrlsAllowed = true;<br>browser.BrowserSettings<br>    .UniversalAccessFromFileUrlsAllowed = true;<br>browser.BrowserSettings<br>    .WebSecurityDisabled = true;</p>
<p>And then you’ll want to wait for the browser to initialize. Now the code I was given for this looks like this:</p>
<p>public static Task WaitForBrowserToInitialize(this ChromiumWebBrowser browser)<br>{<br>    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();</bool></p>
<pre><code>EventHandler handler = null;
handler = (sender, args) =&gt;
{
    browser.BrowserInitialized -= handler;
    tcs.TrySetResult(true);
};
browser.BrowserInitialized += handler;

return tcs.Task;
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>You’ll recognize this as an extension method.  What it is doing is waiting for the BrowserInitialized event to fire and then telling the task it can return.  This works great the first time you use it, but I found that when I created a new browser “window” the initialization happened so quickly that this was unreliable.  I’ve replaced this code with the more reliable version below.</p>
<p>public static Task WaitForBrowserToInitialize<br>    (this ChromiumWebBrowser browser)<br>{<br>    while (!Browser.IsBrowserInitialized)<br>    {<br>        await Task.Delay(100);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>It does the same thing.  It is just more reliable.</p>
<h2 id="Load-a-Page"><a href="#Load-a-Page" class="headerlink" title="Load a Page"></a>Load a Page</h2><p>Everything else is pretty straight forward.  To load a web page:</p>
<p>public static Task LoadUrl(this ChromiumWebBrowser browser,string url)<br>{<br>    browser.Load(url);<br>    return browser.WaitForPage();<br>}</p>
<p>That WaitForPage() method looks like this:</p>
<p>public static Task WaitForPage(this ChromiumWebBrowser browser)<br>{<br>    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();<br>    EventHandler<navstatechangedeventargs> handler = null;<br>    handler = (sender, args) =&gt;<br>    {<br>        //Wait for while page to finish loading not<br>        // just the first frame<br>        if (!args.IsLoading)<br>        {<br>            browser.NavStateChanged -= handler;<br>            tcs.TrySetResult(true);<br>        }<br>    };</navstatechangedeventargs></bool></p>
<pre><code>browser.NavStateChanged += handler;
return tcs.Task;
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<h2 id="Get-Data-Out"><a href="#Get-Data-Out" class="headerlink" title="Get Data Out"></a>Get Data Out</h2><p>If you need to get data out of the page, you can use GetSourceAsync();</p>
<p>var source = await browser.GetSourceAsync();</p>
<p>or you can use JavaScript to get at the DOM using</p>
<p>await EvaluateScriptAsync(javaScriptCodeHere);</p>
<p>  Note, you can also use EvaluateScriptAsync to do things like clicking buttons, scrolling the window and a lot of other useful things.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/06/spider.jpg" alt="spider" title="spider"> It amazes me how rare the skill of debugging software is.  It is even more amazing to me that after programming for over 27 years now, I still have trouble with this.  So, as a checklist for myself, and as a possible help to others along the way, I offer you “How to Debug Your Code” </p>
<h2 id="Is-It-Plugged-In-Is-It-Turned-On"><a href="#Is-It-Plugged-In-Is-It-Turned-On" class="headerlink" title="Is It Plugged In?  Is It Turned On?"></a>Is It Plugged In?  Is It Turned On?</h2><p>Another way of stating this is, “Validate your assumptions.”  I learned this phrase while I was traveling with a high school music group as a sound tech.  I was one of two guys who was responsible for making sure the sound equipment got from one site to the other and got setup at each site and was ready to go in time for the group to practice at least once before the performed. The thing with sound equipment is, there are lots of connections.  Lots of places to miss.  There were many times that we would set everything up and test it all out and there would be no sound, or partial sound.  I’m ashamed to tell you how many hours we wasted tracking the problem down only to find that something wasn’t connected.  An amp wasn’t turned on.  A plug had come out of the wall.  Cables had become disconnected. And the same sort of thing happens with our code.  You deploy code to the wrong directory and wonder why it isn’t showing up in the browser.  You deploy code to the right directory, but you forgot to get it from version control before you did.</p>
<h2 id="Read-the-Error-Message"><a href="#Read-the-Error-Message" class="headerlink" title="Read the Error Message"></a>Read the Error Message</h2><p>This is especially true with .NET but even when all you have is an error code, the error message is useful. In .NET, when you get an error message, it all but tells you what line of code you need to fix.  And even if you don’t understand the error.  You can copy and paste the error into a search engine and you are likely to come up with multiple possible solutions.  Even if all you have is an error code.</p>
<h2 id="Sometimes-the-Error-Message-Is-Hidden"><a href="#Sometimes-the-Error-Message-Is-Hidden" class="headerlink" title="Sometimes the Error Message Is Hidden"></a>Sometimes the Error Message Is Hidden</h2><p>I was just working on some code last night after putting in a very long day.  My code wasn’t working so I finally decided to pull up the debugger.  In this case, the code was JavaScript and I’m running it in Chrome because what I’m writing is a Chrome plugin.  When I finally loaded the plugin with the debugger active, it was then that I saw the console log message telling me that my variable wasn’t defined.  Talk about stupid mistakes.  My variable was code I meant to enter as a string, but because I didn’t put quotes around it, the JavaScript engine saw it as an undefined variable.</p>
<h2 id="Run-the-Debugger"><a href="#Run-the-Debugger" class="headerlink" title="Run the Debugger"></a>Run the Debugger</h2><p>Once I’ve eliminated the obvious, the next thing is to pull out the debugger and set break points.  Now, this can be tedious.  How many times have you decided to step over when you should have stepped in?  Arrrgh.  Now I have to start over again. Well, here’s how I speed things up. At the top level function.  I initially step over until I find out what line is causing the problem.  If you have an exception that is being thrown, this is easy to do because you just have to wait for the exception.  If you are getting a wrong answer, it may be a bit more difficult because you’ll have to verify your expected results along the way.  But the point is, you need to find out what line is throwing things off or you will be there all day, stepping through code one line at a time. Once you know which line in that function is causing trouble, you step into that line on the next run and step over each line in the lower level function until you find out what line is causing a problem there. Rinse, lather, repeat, until you find the problem.</p>
<h2 id="Step-In-To-Libraries"><a href="#Step-In-To-Libraries" class="headerlink" title="Step In To Libraries"></a>Step In To Libraries</h2><p>This goes back to validating your assumptions, but I call it out here separately because we never think that we’ve made an assumption about something that is supposed to be a “black box” when in fact, we have. Back in the day when I was doing a lot of Visual C++ coding, I learned a lot about how MFC worked by stepping into the MFC code.  So much so that I became the expert in my office regarding fixing C++/MFC related bugs. Today I’m doing a lot of JavaScript coding.  For the last two years I’ve actually done more JavaScript than C#.  Specifically, I’m writing a lot of EXTjs code.  The thing about EXTjs is that the framework is pretty complex.  I would argue too complex.  But that’s another post.  What I want to point out here is that I’ve fixed a lot of issues with my EXTjs code by stepping into the EXTjs framework code, as painful as that was, to find out why my code was behaving the way it was.</p>
<h2 id="The-Search-Engines-Are-Your-Friends"><a href="#The-Search-Engines-Are-Your-Friends" class="headerlink" title="The Search Engines Are Your Friends"></a>The Search Engines Are Your Friends</h2><p>This one should be obvious.  But, unfortunately it isn’t. The hardest part about searching is trying to figure out what other people may have used to describe the problem so that you can find the answer that is just sitting out there waiting for you.  I’m convinced that as intelligent as the search engines have become, using them is still a kind of art.</p>
<h2 id="Explain-the-Problem-to-a-Co-Worker"><a href="#Explain-the-Problem-to-a-Co-Worker" class="headerlink" title="Explain the Problem to a Co-Worker"></a>Explain the Problem to a Co-Worker</h2><p>You would be amazed at how often the act of describing a problem to someone else brings the obvious solution to light.  If you’ve ever done this, you know that often, in the middle of describing the problem, you’ll says, “… oh, never mind.  I know what the problem is now.” Which leads to my alternative solutions…</p>
<h2 id="Explain-the-Problem-to-Your-Coffee-Cup"><a href="#Explain-the-Problem-to-Your-Coffee-Cup" class="headerlink" title="Explain the Problem to Your Coffee Cup"></a>Explain the Problem to Your Coffee Cup</h2><p>Why?   Because it isn’t your co-worker who helped you solve the problem when you explained it to him.  It was the act of explaining it.  Once you’ve articulated the problem well enough to explain it to someone else, that act actually often hands you the solution.</p>
<h2 id="Step-Away-For-a-While"><a href="#Step-Away-For-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Step Away For a While"></a>Step Away For a While</h2><p>I don’t know why it is, but for some reason, we seem to think that if we aren’t coding, we aren’t working.  But you can’t work non-stop as a programmer for 4 – 8 hours without taking a break.  And banging your head against a bug when you’ve already done that for 15 minutes probably isn’t going to produce any better results if you do it for another 4 hours. Yeah, you may try a bunch of stuff.  You may look busy.  But the fact of the matter is, you might be better off finding something else to do for an hour or so and then coming back to the problem once you’re brain has had a rest from it. Well, those are my tips for now.  What tips do you have?  Leave them in the comments.  </p>

<p>If you’ve been programming in any other environment than JavaScript for a while, you may be making assumptions about JavaScript Scope that just aren’t true.  One of those assumptions is how variables get evaluated when you run the JavaScript code and what variables are visible and at what point in the code they are visible.</p>
<p>Just as a test to see how well you know your JavaScript, let’s create a few tests scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="Quiz"><a href="#Quiz" class="headerlink" title="Quiz"></a>Quiz</h2><h3 id="1-Given-the-following-code"><a href="#1-Given-the-following-code" class="headerlink" title="1) Given the following code:"></a>1) Given the following code:</h3><p>var foo;<br>foo = “xyz”;</p>
<p>function bar()<br>{<br>    foo = “abc”;<br>    var foo;<br>}<br>bar();<br>console.log(foo);</p>
<p>What is displayed in the console window when console.log(foo) is executed?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<h3 id="2-Given-the-following-code"><a href="#2-Given-the-following-code" class="headerlink" title="2) Given the following code:"></a>2) Given the following code:</h3><p>var i = 20;</p>
<p>for(var i = 0;i &lt; 10;i++){<br>    console.log(i);<br>}</p>
<p>console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i);</p>
<p>What is the value of i when console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i) is executed?</p>
<p>Why?</p>

<p>var foo = function(){<br>    console.log(‘foo was called’);<br>}</p>

<p>function foo(){<br>    console.log(‘foo was called’);<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Answers"><a href="#Answers" class="headerlink" title="Answers"></a>Answers</h2><p>1) The value of foo when console.log(foo) is executed is “xyz”</p>
<p>2) The value of i when console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i) is executed is 10</p>
<p>3) foo is declared but undefined when we try to call it on the first line</p>
<p>4) because foo is both declared and defined when it is called on the first line</p>
<h2 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h2><p>How did you do?</p>
<h2 id="1-“Hoisting”"><a href="#1-“Hoisting”" class="headerlink" title="1) “Hoisting”"></a>1) “Hoisting”</h2><p>The first thing you need to understand about how JavaScript processes code is that it goes through the block of code you are working with and processes the variable declarations first.  That is anything in the global scope (window for browsers, global for server) or anything within a function block.  From the JavaScript compiler’s perspective, the code in example 1 looks like this:</p>
<p>var foo;<br>foo = “xyz”;</p>
<p>function bar()<br>{<br>    var foo;<br>    foo = “abc”;<br>}<br>bar();<br>console.log(foo);</p>
<p>So that the foo = “abc” line assigns the string “abc” to the variable foo in the bar function’s local scope.  Not impacting the variable foo in global scope so that the result at the end of the code sample is that the foo variable still has the value “xyz”.</p>
<h2 id="2-Only-functions-and-catch-blocks-create-“block-scope”"><a href="#2-Only-functions-and-catch-blocks-create-“block-scope”" class="headerlink" title="2) Only functions and catch blocks create “block scope”"></a>2) Only functions and catch blocks create “block scope”</h2><p>In most languages that I use, if I wanted to create a variable that only had effect within a for, if, or while block, I could create a variable within the braces, or inline like in this example, and the code in the outer block would be left untouched.  But in JavaScript, this would only work if you were using the LET keyword which only appears in ECMA6 and above.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, it is perfectly legal to declare a variable multiple time.  The compiler will not complain.  So, when we run the code in example 2, the declaration within the for() is ignored and it just reuses the declaration at the beginning of the code snippet.</p>
<p>If you really wanted to declare a function within its own scope, you could create the scope with a try/catch block, like this:</p>
<p>try {throw i;}<br>catch(i){<br>    for(var i = 0;i&lt; 10;i++) {<br>        console.log(i);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i);</p>
<p>Which would give you the behavior you were probably expecting.  The code above will print out ‘final i: 20’ like you were probably expecting above.</p>
<h2 id="3-“Hoisting”-and-function-assignments"><a href="#3-“Hoisting”-and-function-assignments" class="headerlink" title="3) “Hoisting” and function assignments"></a>3) “Hoisting” and function assignments</h2><p>Going back to our discussion about variable declarations being processed first, and then doing any assignments, it becomes obvious that we can’t call a function that we haven’t assigned to the variable yet.  I don’t think I need to discuss this any further than I already have.  This works like any other variable declaration as I’ve discussed above.</p>
<h2 id="4-“Hoisting”-and-function-declarations"><a href="#4-“Hoisting”-and-function-declarations" class="headerlink" title="4) “Hoisting” and function declarations"></a>4) “Hoisting” and function declarations</h2><p>Function declarations, on the other hand, behave differently than function assignments.  In the case of function declarations, the variable AND the function that is “assigned” to it get pulled to the top of our code.  So using function declarations over function assignments is preferred simply because it assures us that the function pointer is available whenever we need it.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, maybe you thought you knew JavaScript.  Maybe you did.  Maybe you discovered you didn’t know it as well as you thought. I would encourage you to really learn the language.  One of the best resources I’ve found for learning programming stuff is <a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight</a>.  Check them out.

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/CHIL0007.png" alt="CHIL0007" title="CHIL0007">There is a guy I’m working with who is trying to wrap his head around design principles.  He’s been watching a lot of <a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight videos</a>.  As he was processing information about <a href="/pluralsightIoC">Inversion of Control</a>, he asked the natural question I’ve never actually considered before.  “Why is it called Inversion of Control?  Normally, when you talk about ‘Inversion’ you are talking about reversing something or negating something.  That isn’t what we are doing here.” </p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Inversion-of-Control"><a href="#What-Is-Inversion-of-Control" class="headerlink" title="What Is Inversion of Control?"></a>What Is Inversion of Control?</h2><p>So, let’s start with a definition of what Inversion of Control is.  And let’s start the definition by explaining what it isn’t. In the old days, back when I started programming.  We had this thing called “Procedural Programming.” Control of your application flowed from beginning to end with looping to take care of any kind of waiting that needed to take place.  <a href="//martinfowler.com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html">Martin Fowler describes this</a> using an illustration that is version similar to a basic “How to program in C#” console application that is in the beginning of most beginner programming books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s consider a simple example. Imagine I’m writing a program to get some information from a user and I’m using a command line enquiry. I might do it something like this</p>
<p>  #ruby<br>  puts ‘What is your name?’<br>  name = gets<br>  process_name(name)<br>  puts ‘What is your quest?’<br>  quest = gets<br>  process_quest(quest)</p>
<p>In this interaction, my code is in control: it decides when to ask questions, when to read responses, and when to process those results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Inversion of Control does is that it puts something other than the main code in charge of doing critical parts of the program so that those other parts of the program can be swapped out by the person implementing the code.</p>
<h2 id="Examples-of-Inversion-of-Control"><a href="#Examples-of-Inversion-of-Control" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Inversion of Control"></a>Examples of Inversion of Control</h2><p>If you’ve ever written a WebForms or Windows Forms application, you’ve already experience inversion of control.</p>
<h3 id="OnPageLoad-or-OnFormLoad"><a href="#OnPageLoad-or-OnFormLoad" class="headerlink" title="OnPageLoad() or OnFormLoad()"></a>OnPageLoad() or OnFormLoad()</h3><p>You have probably never even given this much thought.  You think these two methods are where your code starts.  But the reality is, the code started long before these methods ever got called.  The thing that is in control is the .NET framework.  You’ve created a delegate that gets called by the framework so that your page or form does what you want it to.  Without this inversion of control, you would have to write a whole lot more code.</p>
<h3 id="Event-Handlers"><a href="#Event-Handlers" class="headerlink" title="Event Handlers"></a>Event Handlers</h3><p>While you might think of OnPageLoad and OnFormLoad as event handlers, the way they are implemented are more like virtual functions.  Event handlers, on the other hand, are a specific type of delegate that say, “When this thing happens, let me know about it.”  The code that fires the event doesn’t even really care what you do during the event.  Again, the control has been “Inverted” because there is a lot of code that is running that you have no control over and probably have no knowledge of.</p>
<h3 id="Virtual-Functions"><a href="#Virtual-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Functions"></a>Virtual Functions</h3><p>One of my favorite methods of inverting control is to use virtual functions.  I can have a parent class that controls the flow of the program that calls various virtual functions in order.  But my child class can provide the implementation of the functions to make them do various things.  I used this, at one time in the past, to create a framework for submitting links to various bookmarking sites.  They all worked essentially the same way, all I had to do was implement the specific details for each site while 80% of my code stayed the same in the base class.</p>
<h3 id="Delegates-or-Callback-Functions"><a href="#Delegates-or-Callback-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Delegates or Callback Functions"></a>Delegates or Callback Functions</h3><p>Another common way of implementing inversion is by using delegates or callbacks.  This work in a similar way to virtual functions expect that the functions are typically passed in to a method.  Much of the current implementation of JavaScript uses this method of inverting control as a primary pattern (but not limited to it as the only way.)</p>
<h3 id="Dependency-Injection"><a href="#Dependency-Injection" class="headerlink" title="Dependency Injection"></a>Dependency Injection</h3><p>I’ve <a href="/dependency-injection-not-di/">talked about Dependency Injection before</a>.  Again, it is another way of delegating control to something other than the code that has main control.  What I want to make special note of here, though, is that Inversion of Control is not Dependency Injection but Dependency Injection is a form of Inversion of Control.  I think this is where most of the confusion about Inversion of Control comes from.  Most of the literature that talks about Inversion of Control talks about it at the same time they are talking about Dependency Injection.  As though the two concepts were the same.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Inversion-of-Control-Matters"><a href="#Why-Inversion-of-Control-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Inversion of Control Matters"></a>Why Inversion of Control Matters</h2><p>Finally, I want to talk for a bit about why Inversion of Control matters.  Because, for me, it is a lot more important that we understand what we are trying to achieve than it is that we’ve given it the right name or that we even know what name to call it.  All of the examples I’ve provided are things you’ve probably done in your code.  Some of them you’ve done without even knowing you were doing them.  But think about the alternative of not doing them. First, your code would be a lot harder to maintain.  Just think of how hard it would be to write a web site and maintain it if you had to write code that handled all of the work that happens for you behind the scenes. Second, it makes the code more loosely coupled.  And by doing that, it makes the code testable AND it makes the code more flexible and easy to change in the future. Maybe instead of calling it Inversion of Control it should have been called Delegation of Control.  Either way, the concept is to remove as much code as possible from our main controlling code and give the implementation responsibility to something else that can be swapped in without having to change the main loop.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/18Tr.png" alt="SpecFlow Tutorial Session" title="18Tr">A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a post describing <a href="/setting-up-specflow/">how to setup SpecFlow</a> in which I promised to continue with how to actually use it once you have it installed.  What follows is a SpecFlow Tutorial of the tips and tricks I wish I’d known when I was starting out. </p>
<h2 id="Controlling-Associations-between-Features-and-Steps"><a href="#Controlling-Associations-between-Features-and-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Controlling Associations between Features and Steps"></a>Controlling Associations between Features and Steps</h2><p>With what you’ve learned so far, you might be able to successfully put together a set of tests for a particular page that you want to test. But as soon as you start working on the second page, you will probably discover that you have steps that seem to conflict with each other. It is at this point you will find that the ability to associate features with step files becomes critical. Fortunately, this is relatively easy. In your feature file, you will specify a category using the @category syntax and within your step file, you will use the category attribute within the step file at the class level to tie the two together. In your feature file:</p>
<p>@stepFileOne<br>Feature: SpecFlowFeature1<br>    In order to avoid silly mistakes<br>    As a math idiot<br>    I want to be told the sum of two numbers</p>
<p>And in your step file:</p>
<p>namespace SpecFlowDemos<br>{<br>    [Binding]<br>    [Category(“stepFileOne”)]<br>    public sealed class StepFileOne<br>    { …<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>Note, if you put steps in a step file that doesn’t have a category associated with it or you create a feature file that doesn’t have a category assigned to it, you’ll see all of the steps that are available. So you will want to have categories applied to everything. If you need to, you can apply categories to specific scenarios in your feature file and specific steps in your step file to gain even more control.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Repeat-Yourself-DRY"><a href="#Don’t-Repeat-Yourself-DRY" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)"></a>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</h2><h3 id="Background-section"><a href="#Background-section" class="headerlink" title="Background section"></a>Background section</h3><p>It is common to have a set of steps that repeat for each scenario. Much like a setup section in NUnit or MSTest. One of the ways you can handle this is by creating a background section.</p>
<p>Background:<br>    Given I have entered 50 into the calculator<br>    And I have entered 70 into the calculator</p>
<p>Scenario: Add two numbers<br>    When I press add<br>    Then the result should be 120 on the screen</p>
<p>The background section runs for each scenario in the feature file.</p>
<h3 id="Running-Steps-from-another-Step"><a href="#Running-Steps-from-another-Step" class="headerlink" title="Running Steps from another Step"></a>Running Steps from another Step</h3><p>You could also create a step that combines all of the common steps together and then have that step run all of the steps.</p>
<p>Scenario: Add two numbers<br>    Given the calculator has been setup<br>    When I press add<br>    Then the result should be 120 on the screen</p>
<p>  Then in your Step file, you’ll need to change your Step class to inherit from Step</p>
<p>public sealed class StepFileOne : Steps<br>{<br> …<br>}</p>
<p>And then create your step to call the other steps like this:</p>
<p>[Given(@”the calculator has been setup”)]<br>public void GivenTheCalculatorHasBeenSetup()<br>{<br>    Given(“I have entered 50 into the calculator”);<br>    Given(“I have entered 70 into the calculator”);<br>}</p>
<p>Yes, you could call the methods directly, but only if the methods are in the same class.  If you have step methods that span multiple classes, you’ll want to use this method so that you can maintain the context of the test you are running.</p>
<h3 id="Before-After-Attributes"><a href="#Before-After-Attributes" class="headerlink" title="Before/After Attributes"></a>Before/After Attributes</h3><p>Finally, you may have setup steps that really have nothing to do with the actual test. In the case of testing web pages or other applications, you’ll probably have to load the page or start up the application and wait for the page to be ready to use prior to doing anything else. And once you have completed your test, you’ll want to do some clean up. At the very least, you’ll want to close the web page. For this, SpecFlow provides the Before attribute and the After attribute. Just like the step definitions, the methods attributed with Before and After will run based on the categories they are associated with.</p>
<p>[Before]<br>public void BeforeScenario(“categoryToAssociateWith”)<br>{<br>    //TODO: implement logic that has to<br>    // run before executing each scenario<br>}</p>
<p>[After]<br>public void AfterScenario(“categoryToAssociateWith”)<br>{<br>    //TODO: implement logic that has to<br>    //run after executing each scenario<br>}</p>
<p>Other before/after attributes that you can use (from <a href="//www.specflow.org/documentation/Hooks/">//www.specflow.org/documentation/Hooks/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Attribute</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tag filtering</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>[BeforeTestRun] [AfterTestRun]</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after the entire test run_Note: As the most of the unit test runners do not provide a hook for executing logic after the test execution has been finished, the [AfterTestRun] event is triggered by the test assembly unload event. The exact timing and thread of this execution might be different for each test runner._The method it is applied to must be static.</p>
<p>[BeforeFeature] [AfterFeature]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each featureThe method it is applied to must be static.</p>
<p>[BeforeScenario] or [Before] [AfterScenario] or [After]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario or scenario outline exampleThe short attribute names are available from v1.8.</p>
<p>[BeforeScenarioBlock] [AfterScenarioBlock]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario block (e.g. between the “givens” and the “whens”)</p>
<p>[BeforeStep] [AfterStep]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario step</p>
<p>You can annotate a single method with multiple attributes.</p>
<h2 id="Sharing-Data-Between-Step-and-Binding-Files"><a href="#Sharing-Data-Between-Step-and-Binding-Files" class="headerlink" title="Sharing Data Between Step and Binding Files"></a>Sharing Data Between Step and Binding Files</h2><p>Once you’ve setup your tests with the <code>Before</code> and <code>After</code> methods, you will probably need to save the information in a location where you can get to it while you are running the tests. You might be tempted to place this information in a member variable or a property but, if you’ve done as I’ve suggested, and placed your <code>Before</code> and <code>After</code> methods in separate files from your steps, you’ll see that this won’t make a lot of sense. Instead, what I recommend that you do is that you save the information into the <code>ScenarioContext</code> object using this syntax.</p>
<p>ScenarioContext.Current[“page”] = someValue;</p>
<p>Then, later on in your testing process, you can retrieve the value using:</p>
<p>var x = (RealObjectType)ScenarioContext.Current[“page”])</p>
<p>where “RealObjectType” is a class name that represents the type of the object that you originally stored. I typically use the Before and After scenarios to open and close the page I want to test while using Selenium. Without going into a whole lot of detail about how this works, my Before and After routine looks something like this:</p>
<p>private ISpmInitial Page<br>{<br>    get { return (ISpmInitial)(ScenarioContext.Current[“page”]); }<br>    set { ScenarioContext.Current[“page”] = value; }<br>}</p>
<p>[Before]<br>public void Before()<br>{<br>    const string id = “10039219”;<br>    var pages = new ConcurrentStack<ispminitial>();<br>    Parallel.Invoke(<br>        () => pages.Push(SpmPageFactory.GetPageModel(“FireFoxGrid”, id))<br>        ,<br>        () => pages.Push(SpmPageFactory.GetPageModel(“IE11Grid”, id))<br>    );<br>    var pagesArray = pages.ToArray();<br>    Page = new ParallelPage<ispminitial>(pagesArray).Cast();<br>}</ispminitial></ispminitial></p>
<p>[After]<br>public void After()<br>{<br>    if (Page == null) return;<br>    Page.Dispose();<br>    Page = null;<br>}</p>
<p>This code is using the Selenium parallelization code I’ve already talked about in my article, <a href="/running-selenium-in-parallel-with-any-net-unit-testing-tool/">Running Selenium In Parallel With Any .NET Unit Testing Tool</a>. The <code>Before</code> method creates my page object for the browsers I’m using. Once I have the page object, I store it into my private <code>Page</code> property which uses the <code>ScenarioContext</code> as the backing store. Then, in the step files that need access to this same page object, I create a similar <code>Page</code> property so that they can access the page object from the steps.</p>
<h2 id="Parameterized-Tests"><a href="#Parameterized-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Parameterized Tests"></a>Parameterized Tests</h2><p>It is quite common to have tests for multiple scenarios that essentially look the same except for the parameters change. Instead of using copy/paste/modify, you can create parameterized test by using the Scenario Outline directive.</p>
<p>Scenario Outline: Uses parameters<br>    Given I have entered <n1> into the calculator<br>    And I have entered <n2> into the calculator<br>    When I press <operation><br>    Then the result should be <result> on the screen</result></operation></n2></n1></p>
<pre><code>Examples: 
| n1 | n2 | operation | result |
| 1  | 2  | add       | 3      |
| 5  | 3  | subtract  | 2      |
| 5  | -3 | add       | 2      |
</code></pre><p>Keep in mind that the step that gets run is based on the merged result. So you could have multiple steps that implement any particular line in your scenario outline.</p>
<h2 id="Alternate-ways-of-structuring-your-test"><a href="#Alternate-ways-of-structuring-your-test" class="headerlink" title="Alternate ways of structuring your test"></a>Alternate ways of structuring your test</h2><h3 id="Data-Tables"><a href="#Data-Tables" class="headerlink" title="Data Tables"></a>Data Tables</h3><p>Scenario: Data Table Example<br>    Given I’ve Entered The Following Information<br>    | Field     | Value                   |<br>    | FirstName | “Dave”                  |<br>    | LastName  | “Bush”                  |<br>    | email     | “<a href="mailto:davembush@dmbcllc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">davembush@dmbcllc.com</a>“ |</p>
<p>  The first column is the names of the fields. The second column is the values. To pull the information out in the step, create, or use an existing class that has the same field names and write code similar to the following in your step.</p>
<p>class Person<br>{<br>    string FirstName { get; set; }<br>    string LastName { get; set; }<br>    string email { get; set; }<br>}</p>
<p>[Given(@”I’ve Entered The Following Information”)]<br>public void GivenIVeEnteredTheFollowingInformation(Table table)<br>{<br>    var person = table.CreateInstance<person>();<br>    // Do something with person here<br>}</person></p>
<p>You can use a horizontal layout like this:</p>
<p>Scenario: Data Table Example<br>    Given I’ve Entered The Following Information<br>    | FirstName | LastName | email                   |<br>    | “Dave”    | “Bush”   | “<a href="mailto:davembush@dmbcllc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">davembush@dmbcllc.com</a>“ |<br>    | “John”    | “Doe”    | “<a href="mailto:jdoe@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jdoe@gmail.com</a>“        |</p>
<p>In this case you use the <code>CreateSet</code> call to create a list of Person objects.</p>
<p>[Given(@”I’ve Entered The Following Information”)]<br>public void GivenIVeEnteredTheFollowingInformation<br>    (Table table)<br>{<br>    var people = table.CreateSet<person>();<br>    // Do something with people here<br>}</person></p>
<p>Finally, you may have the need to enter parameter data that is longer than will reasonably fit on one line or that needs to be on multiple lines. To do that, you delimit the beginning and end of the multi-line section with three double quotes.</p>
<p>[Given(@”I have lots of text”)]<br>public void GivenIHaveLotsOfText(string multilineText)<br>{<br>    ScenarioContext.Current.Pending();<br>}</p>
<p>The multi-line text will be passed as the last parameter in your step method. There are probably some features I missed here.  But this is already more than what I use on a day to day basis in my own SpecFlow testing scenarios.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/land-0125.jpg" alt="land-0125" title="land-0125">Way back in the day when lines were first being painted on roads.  The early lines were painted by hand.  In those days, a painter was hired and given a stretch of road to paint.  The first day he got on very well.  In fact, he was one of the best line painters they had ever had.  His lines were perfectly aligned, there were no unpainted areas in the space where there should be paint, and he managed to get 500 yards of road painted.  The average line painter normally did 250 yards in the first day.  The managers who had hired him were quite pleased.</p>
<p>Well, the next day, he came to work and set off on his task of painting the road.  He still had another 500 yards of road to paint.  And yet, for as fast as he was, he was only able to get 350 yards painted that day.  Not quite what his managers expected given his performance on the first day.  But still, better than their average painter, and so they reasoned to themselves, “Maybe he hit an extra hilly patch of road or some other unforeseen obstacle got in his way.”</p>
<p>Finally, the third day, he came in and finished the patch of road he had been given.</p>
<p>Since he had done so well on the first 1000 yards of road, management decided to put him on a job of a 1 mile stretch of road.  They also decided to make him the lead painter with a crew of 10 other painters who they had just hired.  He taught these new hires how to paint the road as he had been painting the road to date and they set off.  The first day was a great day.  They managed to get an average of 300 yards per person completed the first day.  Not quite what management had expected, but still better than the average line painter could do.</p>
<p>The next day they all came to work and continued their painting.  Yet, this time, all they were able to accomplish was 200 yards per person.</p>
<p>Predictably the next day they all came to work and continued their painting but only got 100 yards per person done.</p>
<p>Of course management got concerned and since this was a rather easy job, they couldn’t understand how the painting could keep getting slower every day.  But obviously, since they had deadlines to meet, it was time to hire some more painters.  So they added another 10 painters to the job.  This had the impact of turning the lead painter into a manager, without the pay of a manager, and in the end, it actually slowed the painting down even more because all of the painters were getting in each other’s way.</p>
<h2 id="A-Good-Idea"><a href="#A-Good-Idea" class="headerlink" title="A Good Idea"></a>A Good Idea</h2><p>One day, as they were painting, one of the painters mentioned that he had been reading that if they paired up and had one of the painters move the paint while the other painted the line and then they switched off painting or moving the paint, that the end result would be that they would actually end up completing the painting faster.  But his peer replied with several objections, the first being that they didn’t have permission to move the paint can.  If management had wanted them to move the paint can then that would have been part of the training they had received on the first day.  Others pointed out that obviously if they only had half of the people painting, it would take even longer to get the painting done.  Others were a lot more honest and just said, “I’m really not sure how we could move the paint.  The paint bucket is so heavy.</p>
<h2 id="Tell-The-Boss"><a href="#Tell-The-Boss" class="headerlink" title="Tell The Boss?"></a>Tell The Boss?</h2><p>Well, you know the type.  Guys with good ideas are hard to stop.  So at the end of the day as they were cleaning up, he mentioned to the lead painter that he had an idea that might make the job move a little faster.  What if we rigged the paint so that it could be moved along as we painted?  Then we wouldn’t have to keep walking back to the paint can.  In fact, we could pair up and have one guy move the paint while the other spent his time continuously painting.  And by switching back and forth between painting and moving paint, no one would get excessively tired doing one or the other.</p>
<p>Well, the lead painter was of course feeling threatened at this point and so he told this young up-start painter that he was hired to paint.  Not to innovate with stupid ideas that would obviously make the job take even longer.</p>
<h2 id="Quit"><a href="#Quit" class="headerlink" title="Quit"></a>Quit</h2><p>Well, now.  Not being content to keep doing things the hard way, the innovative young painter quit this crew and went to work for a new road crew who advertised themselves as “innovative, fun and open to suggestions.”  Well, I’m sure you can predict exactly what happened next.</p>
<p>The day he started on the job he found that they were painting the road exactly the same place as the last crew he worked on.  Of course, he mentioned his innovative idea, and of course, he got the same responses.</p>
<p>Frustrated, he kept moving from company to company only to find out that they nearly all had the same attitude.  And so, he decided that since at each company he was pretty well left on his own to paint the lines, it wouldn’t hurt if he rigged up a wheel barrow with some paint cans so that he could fill the paint cans from the main paint receptacle and then carry the paint to the location he was painting.  This would reduce the amount of trips back to the main paint container and it really wouldn’t disrupt the work of anyone else.</p>
<h2 id="It-Is-The-Same-Everywhere"><a href="#It-Is-The-Same-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="It Is The Same Everywhere"></a>It Is The Same Everywhere</h2><p>There was just one problem with this.  As he started out on the new job, he found that all the nay-sayers were right.  It really did slow things down.  While before he was able to get 500 yards of road done on the first day, this time he was only able to get 300 yards of road done.  He was feeling a bit discouraged, and yet convinced that if he persisted the next day would prove him right, he continued.  Sure enough, while the average painter was able to get 200 yards done on the second day, he was able to continue with 300 yards on the second day as well.  In fact, as everyone else seemed to get slower, the innovative painter was able to get 300 yards of road done every day he painted.</p>
<h2 id="The-Promotion"><a href="#The-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="The Promotion"></a>The Promotion</h2><p>Well, now he has management’s attention.  Let’s promote him.</p>
<p>Well sir, he got promoted sure enough.  You know what the first thing he tried to implement?  Yep, how about if we change our whole process to move the paint can.  Well, I’m sure you know how well that went off. </p>
<p>“We’ve been painting roads like this for 10 years and it works just fine.”</p>
<h2 id="More-Frustration"><a href="#More-Frustration" class="headerlink" title="More Frustration"></a>More Frustration</h2><p>Even with his own team, he couldn’t get the “move the paint” method of painting roads fully implemented, no matter how hard he tried.  Yeah, there were a few pockets of painters who gave it a try, but ultimately, since it felt slower than what they had always done, they fell back to the old method they knew so well.</p>
<p>And then, one day, a new painter came on the team who believed in the move the paint method.  He used  it and found another guy on the team who was willing to pair with him so that one would move the paint and the other would paint.  Wow!  The progress they made!</p>
<p>As they were working, one of them said, “I wonder if we can rig the wheelbarrow to drip the paint out so that we only have to spread it instead of having to dip the brush into the paint…</p>

  <div class="article-inner">

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’ve been asked to train a group of developers in the use of <a href="//www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> so that they can use it to write Selenium Tests.  So, in an attempt to “kill two birds with one stone” I thought today’s post would cover how to get the SpecFlow environment setup.  Not only will it help me prepare for the training session I will be leading, but it will help me when I need to set this up the next time because it tends to be a bit confusing when you setup a new project.  You’ll see why in a bit.</p>
<h2 id="Installing-SpecFlow"><a href="#Installing-SpecFlow" class="headerlink" title="Installing SpecFlow"></a>Installing SpecFlow</h2><p>The first thing you’ll want to do is to install the SpecFlow Visual Studio integration.  You do this by navigating to “Tools” –&gt; “Extension and Updates …” <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> This will bring up a dialog box where you’ll want to select the “Online” branch <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> You will notice in the upper right corner of this dialog, a search box.  Type in “SpecFlow” to find the SpecFlow extensions. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> In the image above, I’ve already installed it, so there is a check box.  You’ll want to click the “Download” or “Install” button that displays when it isn’t installed.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-a-Test-Project"><a href="#Creating-a-Test-Project" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Test Project"></a>Creating a Test Project</h2><p>Now that you’ve installed the extension, you can create a new test project.  You might expect a SpecFlow template to appear somewhere in the project list.  Sorry, that’s not what you get.  You could create one yourself if you really wanted.  To create a SpecFlow project, all you really need to do is to create a Class Library project. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image3.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Adding-a-Reference"><a href="#Adding-a-Reference" class="headerlink" title="Adding a Reference"></a>Adding a Reference</h2><p>And now, this is where I always get tripped up for a minute.  You can create a new feature file, but there is a menu item you should see that will allow you to add feature steps to a class file and you won’t see that until you add a reference to SpecFlow.  To do that, you will need to go back to NuGet.  This time use the menu option, “Tools” –&gt; “NuGet Package Manager” –&gt; “Manage NuGet Packages for Solution…” <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image4.png" alt="image" title="image"> Once again a dialog will display.  Make sure you are in the “Online” branch on the left and type “SpecFlow” into the search area in the upper right corner of the dialog. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image5.png" alt="image" title="image"> I always use SpecFlow with NUnit, if you install SpecFlow.NUnit it will automatically install the SpecFlow dependencies with it.  If you prefer to use xUnit, you can install that and the SpecFlow dependencies will install automatically.</p>
<h2 id="Create-Your-First-Feature-File"><a href="#Create-Your-First-Feature-File" class="headerlink" title="Create Your First Feature File"></a>Create Your First Feature File</h2><p>Now that you have the environment setup, you can actually use SpecFlow.  To create your first feature file, you can right click on the project and select “Add” –&gt; “New Item…” from the context menu.  Just like you would add a new file to the project any other time.  From the resulting dialog, select “SpecFlow Feature File”, give it an appropriate file name, and click the “Add” button.  When I name my SpecFlow feature files, I try to name them similar to the feature it will be testing. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image6.png" alt="image" title="image"> The resulting feature file will have a sample of how your feature will be setup.  You will want to change this to test whatever it is you are testing.  The next thing you will want to do is to create a Step Definition file.  This is a regular C# file with a Binding attribute added.  The file that SpecFlow will generate for you will match the template they provided in the feature file.  What I want you to do next is the delete all of the methods in the class so that I can show you how to add additional methods.  I’m not going to go to the trouble of showing you the screen shots.  I figure you know how to get to it and the image above shows it listed in the “Add File” dialog. Next, go back to your feature file and right click on the provided “Given” line, you should see a menu option that says, “Generate Step Definitions” <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image7.png" alt="image" title="image"> If you click this, you’ll get a dialog like this: <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image8.png" alt="image" title="image"> A couple of things you should notice.  One is the name of the class you are going to create if you click the “Generate” button.  I would advise against using the generate button.  Instead, we are going to use the “Copy methods to clipboard” method.  If you want to try to keep things segmented, you might choose to copy some of the steps to the clipboard and paste them into one file and copy others and paste them into another file.  This list will only list steps that you don’t already have definitions for, so you don’t need to worry about producing duplicate definitions. If you copy the methods onto the clipboard and paste them into the step file, you should end up with code that is functionally equivalent to what the new file template created for you.</p>
<h2 id="Just-A-Start"><a href="#Just-A-Start" class="headerlink" title="Just A Start"></a>Just A Start</h2><p>This is enough to get you setup, but there is more to cover, so make sure you subscribe to the mailing list to get notified when I post another article about SpecFlow.</p>
