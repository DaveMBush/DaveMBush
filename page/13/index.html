<p>For the last two years, about 99% of the work I’ve been doing has been JavaScript programming using EXTjs.  The problems I’ve encountered along the way are primarily related to testing.  Writing unit test using the “MVC Framework” out of the box is nearly impossible, but I did eventually put together an architecture that allows me to do that.  I may blog about that in the future.</p>
<p>Today, what I want to offer is how I overcame various hurdles related to testing EXTjs with Selenium.  The first problem nearly everyone encounters when they first use EXTjs is that the views that are created are created dynamically.  If you use the recommended itemId to uniquely identify the elements on the page, you will be left with IDs that are dynamically generated and inconsistent.  That is, just because the ID has one value today doesn’t mean it will have the same value tomorrow.  And since the controls are dynamically created based on what browser is running, XPATH queries aren’t a good solution either.</p>

<p>I had this thought this past week that we tend to believe that if we are in motion, we are accomplishing something.  That being busy somehow equals being productive.  And then I started thinking about how this is almost universal.  It doesn’t just impact how we program, which I’ll get to eventually, but it impacts all of our life.</p>

<p>This probably doesn’t happen all that often, but this last week I came across the need to know which browser I was running my selenium test against.  I figured that buried deep in the object structure of Selenium, there MUST be a way of finding out what browser I was currently running.  As it turns out, I was right.  The situation that caused this requirement is that the place where I’m currently writing most of my code is upgrading all the Firefox browsers.  I was asked to make sure the code we were running still works with the new browser.  When I did, I found that some of my tests broke even though the test itself still succeeds when it is run manually.  In fact, they only broke when running against this new version of Firefox.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> Over the past ten years, I’ve successfully implemented various types of screen scraping in order to provide data to my clients.  Most of these implementations have involved accessing HTML and parsing out the data we needed for the web application.</p>
<p>My latest implementation of this made use of the <a href="//htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/">HTML Agility Pack</a> and managed to incorporate the e-Labels For Education site into the Labels For Education site.  (No links, because the e-Labels program is being phased out.) Recently, I’ve been spending a lot of times on some site doing the same thing over and over again.  But most of the sites I visit now implement some kind of AJAX so that doing a simple web request to a page without also loading and parsing the JavaScript ends up giving me a page with no useful data at all.  Unlike the work I’ve done in the past where this was sufficient.</p>
<p>This, combined with my recent work implementing Jasmine unit test for JavaScript and running them in the PhantomJS headless browser has had me thinking, wouldn’t it be great if I could do similar kinds of screen scraping, or even browser automation, but use something like an embedded version of PhantomJS to get the work done.</p>

<p>If you’ve been programming in any other environment than JavaScript for a while, you may be making assumptions about JavaScript Scope that just aren’t true.  One of those assumptions is how variables get evaluated when you run the JavaScript code and what variables are visible and at what point in the code they are visible.</p>
<p>Just as a test to see how well you know your JavaScript, let’s create a few tests scenarios.</p>

As he was processing information about <a href="/pluralsightIoC">Inversion of Control</a>, he asked the natural question I’ve never actually considered before.  “Why is it called Inversion of Control?

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/land-0125.jpg" alt="land-0125" title="land-0125">Way back in the day when lines were first being painted on roads.  The early lines were painted by hand.  In those days, a painter was hired and given a stretch of road to paint.  The first day he got on very well.  In fact, he was one of the best line painters they had ever had.  His lines were perfectly aligned, there were no unpainted areas in the space where there should be paint, and he managed to get 500 yards of road painted.  The average line painter normally did 250 yards in the first day.  The managers who had hired him were quite pleased.</p>
<p>Well, the next day, he came to work and set off on his task of painting the road.  He still had another 500 yards of road to paint.  And yet, for as fast as he was, he was only able to get 350 yards painted that day.  Not quite what his managers expected given his performance on the first day.  But still, better than their average painter, and so they reasoned to themselves, “Maybe he hit an extra hilly patch of road or some other unforeseen obstacle got in his way.”</p>
<p>Finally, the third day, he came in and finished the patch of road he had been given.</p>
<p>Since he had done so well on the first 1000 yards of road, management decided to put him on a job of a 1 mile stretch of road.  They also decided to make him the lead painter with a crew of 10 other painters who they had just hired.  He taught these new hires how to paint the road as he had been painting the road to date and they set off.  The first day was a great day.  They managed to get an average of 300 yards per person completed the first day.  Not quite what management had expected, but still better than the average line painter could do.</p>
<p>The next day they all came to work and continued their painting.  Yet, this time, all they were able to accomplish was 200 yards per person.</p>
<p>Predictably the next day they all came to work and continued their painting but only got 100 yards per person done.</p>
<p>Of course management got concerned and since this was a rather easy job, they couldn’t understand how the painting could keep getting slower every day.  But obviously, since they had deadlines to meet, it was time to hire some more painters.  So they added another 10 painters to the job.  This had the impact of turning the lead painter into a manager, without the pay of a manager, and in the end, it actually slowed the painting down even more because all of the painters were getting in each other’s way.</p>
<h2 id="A-Good-Idea"><a href="#A-Good-Idea" class="headerlink" title="A Good Idea"></a>A Good Idea</h2><p>One day, as they were painting, one of the painters mentioned that he had been reading that if they paired up and had one of the painters move the paint while the other painted the line and then they switched off painting or moving the paint, that the end result would be that they would actually end up completing the painting faster.  But his peer replied with several objections, the first being that they didn’t have permission to move the paint can.  If management had wanted them to move the paint can then that would have been part of the training they had received on the first day.  Others pointed out that obviously if they only had half of the people painting, it would take even longer to get the painting done.  Others were a lot more honest and just said, “I’m really not sure how we could move the paint.  The paint bucket is so heavy.</p>
<h2 id="Tell-The-Boss"><a href="#Tell-The-Boss" class="headerlink" title="Tell The Boss?"></a>Tell The Boss?</h2><p>Well, you know the type.  Guys with good ideas are hard to stop.  So at the end of the day as they were cleaning up, he mentioned to the lead painter that he had an idea that might make the job move a little faster.  What if we rigged the paint so that it could be moved along as we painted?  Then we wouldn’t have to keep walking back to the paint can.  In fact, we could pair up and have one guy move the paint while the other spent his time continuously painting.  And by switching back and forth between painting and moving paint, no one would get excessively tired doing one or the other.</p>
<p>Well, the lead painter was of course feeling threatened at this point and so he told this young up-start painter that he was hired to paint.  Not to innovate with stupid ideas that would obviously make the job take even longer.</p>
<h2 id="Quit"><a href="#Quit" class="headerlink" title="Quit"></a>Quit</h2><p>Well, now.  Not being content to keep doing things the hard way, the innovative young painter quit this crew and went to work for a new road crew who advertised themselves as “innovative, fun and open to suggestions.”  Well, I’m sure you can predict exactly what happened next.</p>
<p>The day he started on the job he found that they were painting the road exactly the same place as the last crew he worked on.  Of course, he mentioned his innovative idea, and of course, he got the same responses.</p>
<p>Frustrated, he kept moving from company to company only to find out that they nearly all had the same attitude.  And so, he decided that since at each company he was pretty well left on his own to paint the lines, it wouldn’t hurt if he rigged up a wheel barrow with some paint cans so that he could fill the paint cans from the main paint receptacle and then carry the paint to the location he was painting.  This would reduce the amount of trips back to the main paint container and it really wouldn’t disrupt the work of anyone else.</p>
<h2 id="It-Is-The-Same-Everywhere"><a href="#It-Is-The-Same-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="It Is The Same Everywhere"></a>It Is The Same Everywhere</h2><p>There was just one problem with this.  As he started out on the new job, he found that all the nay-sayers were right.  It really did slow things down.  While before he was able to get 500 yards of road done on the first day, this time he was only able to get 300 yards of road done.  He was feeling a bit discouraged, and yet convinced that if he persisted the next day would prove him right, he continued.  Sure enough, while the average painter was able to get 200 yards done on the second day, he was able to continue with 300 yards on the second day as well.  In fact, as everyone else seemed to get slower, the innovative painter was able to get 300 yards of road done every day he painted.</p>
<h2 id="The-Promotion"><a href="#The-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="The Promotion"></a>The Promotion</h2><p>Well, now he has management’s attention.  Let’s promote him.</p>
<p>Well sir, he got promoted sure enough.  You know what the first thing he tried to implement?  Yep, how about if we change our whole process to move the paint can.  Well, I’m sure you know how well that went off. </p>
<p>“We’ve been painting roads like this for 10 years and it works just fine.”</p>
<h2 id="More-Frustration"><a href="#More-Frustration" class="headerlink" title="More Frustration"></a>More Frustration</h2><p>Even with his own team, he couldn’t get the “move the paint” method of painting roads fully implemented, no matter how hard he tried.  Yeah, there were a few pockets of painters who gave it a try, but ultimately, since it felt slower than what they had always done, they fell back to the old method they knew so well.</p>
<p>And then, one day, a new painter came on the team who believed in the move the paint method.  He used  it and found another guy on the team who was willing to pair with him so that one would move the paint and the other would paint.  Wow!  The progress they made!</p>
<p>As they were working, one of them said, “I wonder if we can rig the wheelbarrow to drip the paint out so that we only have to spread it instead of having to dip the brush into the paint…</p>

  <div class="article-inner">

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’ve been asked to train a group of developers in the use of <a href="//www.specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> so that they can use it to write Selenium Tests.  So, in an attempt to “kill two birds with one stone” I thought today’s post would cover how to get the SpecFlow environment setup.  Not only will it help me prepare for the training session I will be leading, but it will help me when I need to set this up the next time because it tends to be a bit confusing when you setup a new project.  You’ll see why in a bit.</p>
<h2 id="Installing-SpecFlow"><a href="#Installing-SpecFlow" class="headerlink" title="Installing SpecFlow"></a>Installing SpecFlow</h2><p>The first thing you’ll want to do is to install the SpecFlow Visual Studio integration.  You do this by navigating to “Tools” –&gt; “Extension and Updates …” <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> This will bring up a dialog box where you’ll want to select the “Online” branch <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> You will notice in the upper right corner of this dialog, a search box.  Type in “SpecFlow” to find the SpecFlow extensions. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> In the image above, I’ve already installed it, so there is a check box.  You’ll want to click the “Download” or “Install” button that displays when it isn’t installed.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-a-Test-Project"><a href="#Creating-a-Test-Project" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Test Project"></a>Creating a Test Project</h2><p>Now that you’ve installed the extension, you can create a new test project.  You might expect a SpecFlow template to appear somewhere in the project list.  Sorry, that’s not what you get.  You could create one yourself if you really wanted.  To create a SpecFlow project, all you really need to do is to create a Class Library project. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image3.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Adding-a-Reference"><a href="#Adding-a-Reference" class="headerlink" title="Adding a Reference"></a>Adding a Reference</h2><p>And now, this is where I always get tripped up for a minute.  You can create a new feature file, but there is a menu item you should see that will allow you to add feature steps to a class file and you won’t see that until you add a reference to SpecFlow.  To do that, you will need to go back to NuGet.  This time use the menu option, “Tools” –&gt; “NuGet Package Manager” –&gt; “Manage NuGet Packages for Solution…” <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image4.png" alt="image" title="image"> Once again a dialog will display.  Make sure you are in the “Online” branch on the left and type “SpecFlow” into the search area in the upper right corner of the dialog. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image5.png" alt="image" title="image"> I always use SpecFlow with NUnit, if you install SpecFlow.NUnit it will automatically install the SpecFlow dependencies with it.  If you prefer to use xUnit, you can install that and the SpecFlow dependencies will install automatically.</p>
<h2 id="Create-Your-First-Feature-File"><a href="#Create-Your-First-Feature-File" class="headerlink" title="Create Your First Feature File"></a>Create Your First Feature File</h2><p>Now that you have the environment setup, you can actually use SpecFlow.  To create your first feature file, you can right click on the project and select “Add” –&gt; “New Item…” from the context menu.  Just like you would add a new file to the project any other time.  From the resulting dialog, select “SpecFlow Feature File”, give it an appropriate file name, and click the “Add” button.  When I name my SpecFlow feature files, I try to name them similar to the feature it will be testing. <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image6.png" alt="image" title="image"> The resulting feature file will have a sample of how your feature will be setup.  You will want to change this to test whatever it is you are testing.  The next thing you will want to do is to create a Step Definition file.  This is a regular C# file with a Binding attribute added.  The file that SpecFlow will generate for you will match the template they provided in the feature file.  What I want you to do next is the delete all of the methods in the class so that I can show you how to add additional methods.  I’m not going to go to the trouble of showing you the screen shots.  I figure you know how to get to it and the image above shows it listed in the “Add File” dialog. Next, go back to your feature file and right click on the provided “Given” line, you should see a menu option that says, “Generate Step Definitions” <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image7.png" alt="image" title="image"> If you click this, you’ll get a dialog like this: <img src="/uploads/2015/05/image8.png" alt="image" title="image"> A couple of things you should notice.  One is the name of the class you are going to create if you click the “Generate” button.  I would advise against using the generate button.  Instead, we are going to use the “Copy methods to clipboard” method.  If you want to try to keep things segmented, you might choose to copy some of the steps to the clipboard and paste them into one file and copy others and paste them into another file.  This list will only list steps that you don’t already have definitions for, so you don’t need to worry about producing duplicate definitions. If you copy the methods onto the clipboard and paste them into the step file, you should end up with code that is functionally equivalent to what the new file template created for you.</p>
<h2 id="Just-A-Start"><a href="#Just-A-Start" class="headerlink" title="Just A Start"></a>Just A Start</h2><p>This is enough to get you setup, but there is more to cover, so make sure you subscribe to the mailing list to get notified when I post another article about SpecFlow.</p>

  <div class="article-inner">

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/PEOP0067.png" alt="PEOP0067" title="PEOP0067">A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, we were forced to name variables and methods with very short names.  When I started my career, I was programming Clipper and C.  Clipper was a dBase compiler, so it only had 10 characters available for variable names.  You could write longer variable names if you wanted, but only the first 10 mattered.  I think at the time, C gave us 32 characters.  But now, we aren’t so limited.  And so the argument goes, if you use long variable names,  you shouldn’t need to comment your code.  I’ve argued as much. Of course every time you bring this subject up, you will inevitably find someone who will say, “But don’t we need comments to at least explain what the code was supposed to do?  After all, code is generally hard to read.”  Well, yes I guess it is if you are new to the language.  But should every foreign movie have subtitles?  Would you want native language movies to have subtitles because other people in the room might not understand it?  Must we dumb everything down to the lowest common denominator?  If so, where will it stop? </p>
<h2 id="Sometimes-Comments-Are-Needed"><a href="#Sometimes-Comments-Are-Needed" class="headerlink" title="Sometimes Comments Are Needed"></a>Sometimes Comments Are Needed</h2><p>And yet, I would argue that there are times when comments make sense.  Not so much for what you did, but for explaining why you decided to do it the way you did.  Again, you don’t always have to do this.  But there are times when I write my code that I look at it and think, “If I come back to this three months from now, I’m going to wonder what I was thinking.  I’d better add a comment to make this a bit more clear as to why this statement is here.” You see, it is the WHY that we comment.  Not the what.  The what would be described in the code itself.</p>
<h2 id="A-Perfect-World"><a href="#A-Perfect-World" class="headerlink" title="A Perfect World"></a>A Perfect World</h2><p>But this all assumes a perfect world.  And judging from the comments and blog post I’ve seen on the subject, I believe this is where the real arguments for and against code comments, have their origin. First, let’s assume for a second that you are of the persuasion that you need to comment code to tell the reader what it is you are trying to accomplish.  Where else could we put that information?</p>
<h2 id="Requirements-in-lieu-of-Comments"><a href="#Requirements-in-lieu-of-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Requirements in lieu of Comments"></a>Requirements in lieu of Comments</h2><p>Well, in a perfect world, there would be some kind of requirements document that would state that this feature was needed.  The problem is, of course, it is hard to associate the design document with the code you are writing because most design documents are really long.  Even for the most trivial of programs.  But in an Agile world, there would be some sort of back log.  A list of requirements that are broken down into small enough task that each one can be implemented as a discreet unit.  Even in an environment that is more Scrumerfall than truly Scrum, you could implement this by breaking the requirements down so they all ended up in a task list of some sort. But we still lack the ability to associate the code with the feature. Well, there are several systems available that allow you to associate task in your backlog with code you’ve checked in.   You just associate the code you are checking in with the backlog item it is associated with and the system established a two way link between the code that was changed and the backlog item that it is associated with.</p>
<h2 id="Tests-as-Comments"><a href="#Tests-as-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Tests as Comments"></a>Tests as Comments</h2><p>The next place you might associate changes with what it is you are trying to do is by creating Unit Test for the code you are writing.  The way I write my Unit Test, I have one Unit Test class per method and Given/Arrange I am testing.  Within that class I have a different test for each When/Then or Act/Assert the Given or Arrange I am trying to test.  This allows me to write my test in such a way that I know what class and method is being tested and what the test. So if I have a Class named Math that has an Add function:</p>
<p>namespace Math<br>{<br>    public class Math<br>    {<br>        public int Add(int a, int b)<br>        {<br>            return a + b;<br>        }<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>I might have a test class that looks like:</p>
<p>namespace Math.Math.Add<br>{<br>   [TestFixture]<br>    public class GivenTwoPositiveNumberAsParameters<br>    {<br>        private _math;<br>        [SetUp]<br>        public void Setup()<br>        {<br>            _math = new Math();<br>        }</p>
<pre><code>    \[Test\]
    \[TestCase(1,1)\]
    \[TestCase(5,7)\]
    public void ThenTheResultShouldBePositive(int a, int b)
    {
       Assert.That(_math.Add(a,b), Is.GreaterThan(0));
    }
}
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>Yes, I know the test itself is a weak test.  The point is the structure of the test.  I can find the tests for any one class because the test that are associated with the class are structured in such a way as to find out what the original requirement was for the test.  And so, even if I don’t have any documentation from a backlog or even from a design document.  Because of the structure of the test, it would be relatively simple to write a tool that would let you view your code and the associated test in a hyperlinked fashion so that you could easily identify the tests associated with your code and the code associated with your tests.</p>
<h2 id="TDD-as-Comments-–-A-Story"><a href="#TDD-as-Comments-–-A-Story" class="headerlink" title="TDD as Comments – A Story"></a>TDD as Comments – A Story</h2><p>Right after the dotCom crash, I ended up working for a company that had a system that they had lost the documentation for.  That is, there was no requirements document and they didn’t want to admit to the client we were working for that they had lost the document.  So, my job eventually became one of perpetual bug fixing.  And of course, since I had no idea what the system was supposed to do, I’m sure every time I fixed a bug, I introduced three more.  This was 15 years ago and I had not yet gotten TDD religion.  But looking back on it now, I see that what I could have been doing from day one is that I could have been writing unit test for each bug that came in.  Eventually, my test suite would be my documentation and there wouldn’t be any more bugs. Unlike code comments, if you are running your tests as part of a continuous integration system, you will be forced to keep your test up to date as the code changes.  Obviously, you should be updating the test, or creating new tests before you make changes, but even if you don’t, if you make a change that breaks the test, you will be forced to either fix the code so that the test succeeds or fix the test to match the new requirement. But this doesn’t really address the broader code quality issue.  At times we still need comments and they can’t be addressed by writing unit tests.  But this is why we need at least occasional paired programming and systematic code reviews.</p>
<h2 id="Code-Reviews"><a href="#Code-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="Code Reviews"></a>Code Reviews</h2><p>Several questions should be raised during code reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this code too complex?</li>
<li>Have we named things appropriately?</li>
<li>Are there any dependencies that need to be removed?</li>
<li>Are there any comments that we could add that would help a future developer maintain this code without possibly confusing him when the code changes?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve talked about a lot of these issues before so I’m not going to go into a lot of detail here other than to say that you should notice that I’ve placed the issue of code comments LAST on the list of things to consider.  This is because if you take care of the code quality, you will find that most of the time when you get to the issue of comments, no one will have anything to add.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you are working at an organization where you have no tests, you routinely deal with 1000 line methods, names of things seem arbitrary, you have no real backlog, and your code is not loosely coupled, I can see why you might think you need comments in your code.  But the problem isn’t the lack of comments.  The problem is, you are dealing with bad code.</p>
