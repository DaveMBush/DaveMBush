        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/08/image3.png" alt="image" title="image"> A couple of weeks ago I wrote a post “<a href="/7-c-interview-questions-that-weed-out-the-losers/">7 C# Interview Questions to Weed out Losers</a>” which was my most popular post yet.  As of this writing, it has received over 13,000 views.  It also got a lot of comments. While there are a lot of things I could respond to, the one I want to focus on today is what I would call, “The fallacy of concepts over terminology.” While none of the comments actually come out and say this, several imply that knowing the concept but not knowing the proper term for it is enough.  In conversations with people I’ve worked with, I’ve received similar feedback.  In fact, as recent as three years ago I actually told someone, “If you want someone who can pass some sort of test, I’m probably not your guy.  If you want someone who is an awesome programmer, I’m your guy.” But three more years of experience has changed my mind.</p>
<h2 id="Knowing-the-Proper-Terms-Clarifies-Communication"><a href="#Knowing-the-Proper-Terms-Clarifies-Communication" class="headerlink" title=" Knowing the Proper Terms Clarifies Communication"></a> Knowing the Proper Terms Clarifies Communication</h2><blockquote>
<p>“’When <strong>I</strong> use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.’” – Through the Looking Glass, by Lewis Carroll</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are just a few examples of how knowing what a term actually means helps communication: As I’ve written before, I’ve been using Sencha’s EXTjs at my day job.  When I first started using this environment, the first thing I was told was that it uses the “MVC Architecture.”  Now, to me, MVC has a very specific meaning and more importantly implies certain qualities about how the code should be written.  Primary among them is that the Model, View, and Controller are loosely coupled.  Anyone who has used EXTjs 4 knows this is not necessarily true.  What they call the “Controller” is more accurately called a “ViewController” but even then, it isn’t really.  You can’t have a controller without having a view, which makes the whole thing quite hard to test.  This whole mislabeling thing set me back about two weeks in my attempt to learn the framework. Another example from my work place.  We’ve created our own ORM to access the DB2 database we have to work with.  Why?  Because DB2 doesn’t play nice with Entity Framework.  But here again, I was told that this code implemented a design pattern that it doesn’t really implement.  Since the number of times I have to interact with this code is trivial, it was not as costly to my learning.  But it did cause confusion. Probably the most notable misuse of a word in our industry is the word “Agile.”  As I’ve been interviewing, I’ve run into a lot of companies who call themselves “Agile” but I’ve found that what they mean by “Agile” is very different from how the Agile Manifesto defines Agile.  In fact, one of the questions I ask during the interview to companies who have promoted themselves as “Agile” is, “How do you define Agile?”  One of the first places I asked this question replied, “Oh that just means we program iteratively.” So, knowing the proper term for a concept, makes your communication clear.  But that doesn’t explain why I expect someone I’m interviewing to know the term I’m using.</p>
<h2 id="Knowing-the-Proper-Term-Shortens-Communication"><a href="#Knowing-the-Proper-Term-Shortens-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Knowing the Proper Term Shortens Communication"></a>Knowing the Proper Term Shortens Communication</h2><p>Way back when I was first learning object oriented programming with C++, someone asked me what polymorphism was.  I couldn’t answer because I’d never heard of the word or hadn’t taken the time to find out what it means.  I can’t remember exactly.  But I had the same reaction many of you did.  “I know what virtual functions are and I know how to give a function multiple implementations by changing the signature, I just don’t know the word for it.” But you see, it is much easier to ask, “What is polymorphism?”  Than it is to ask, “What do the keywords ‘overridable’, and ‘overrides’ do?”  And then have to follow up with “what does the ‘new’ keyword do when placed in front of a method declaration?” Spoken languages have terms for the various parts of speech.  If you are a programmer, I’m sure you know about this, even if you can’t name them.  But, let’s say you were a professional writer or an editor.  You probably wouldn’t be able to even get a job if you couldn’t talk about the various parts of speech using the proper terms.  And yet, many of us expect that we should be allowed to write code without having the same ability. Which leads to my next reason.</p>
<h2 id="Knowing-the-Proper-Term-Aids-in-Learning"><a href="#Knowing-the-Proper-Term-Aids-in-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Knowing the Proper Term Aids in Learning"></a>Knowing the Proper Term Aids in Learning</h2><p>My family is a languages family.  My wife knows English, French, Latin (from teaching the kids), and Biblical Greek.  My daughter was an English major and learned Latin during High School.  My oldest son, knows English, Latin, Greek, and a bit of German.  My youngest son knows English, Latin, a bit of Greek and German.  I barely know English well enough to get these post written every week.  Which gives me a unique perspective. What I’ve learned as I’ve watched my family play with languages is that because they know the parts of speech in the various languages, as they pick up a new language, they can talk about a word being in a particular tense, or case, or whatever and everyone knows exactly what they are saying, making it that much easier to pick up a new language. In fact, while my son was learning German in High School, he would come home and talk to his mom and sister in German and they would be able to make out most of what he was saying because they had enough back ground in other languages and when they didn’t know something they could talk about it using the terms for the various parts of speech. This was true for me as I moved from C++ to Java and then to C# and VB.NET.  Because I already knew what polymorphism was, all I needed to know was the mechanisms in the other languages that made that feature happen.</p>
<h2 id="If-You-Know-the-Terminology-You-Probably-Know-the-Concept"><a href="#If-You-Know-the-Terminology-You-Probably-Know-the-Concept" class="headerlink" title="If You Know the Terminology, You Probably Know the Concept"></a>If You Know the Terminology, You Probably Know the Concept</h2><p>One of the complaints I got specifically accused me of asking questions that only proved that the applicant could pass a test.  And this is true.  If all I were to ask were these questions, this would be a bad interview indeed.  But here’s what I’ve found.  Most of the time, if you can answer the questions I’ve asked in that article, you are much more likely to be able to answer the questions I really care about.  “Are you a hack, or do you really know what you are doing?” The market is flooded with programmers with less than 5 years of experience being presented by recruiters who know nothing about programming. Using the metric of charity over what I see coming in for interviews, here is what I think is happening. Recruiter sees an applicant that has most of the buzzwords on his resume that the company they are recruiting for is looking for.  But they are missing a critical buzzword, so the recruiter adds this prior to passing the resume on. Having been on a lot of interviews over the years, I have to assume that this works enough of the time to make it worthwhile because there are some places that I’ve interviewed where I haven’t had to prove I was technically capable at all.  In fact, I’ve been on a few interviews where the resume they have for me doesn’t look anything like what I gave the recruiter. And so, those of us on the receiving end of this have to have some quick way of determining, “do you know anything?”</p>
<h2 id="Knowing-the-Concept-Isn’t-Enough"><a href="#Knowing-the-Concept-Isn’t-Enough" class="headerlink" title="Knowing the Concept Isn’t Enough"></a>Knowing the Concept Isn’t Enough</h2><p>Keep in mind, I used to think that knowing the concept WAS enough.  But what I’ve come to realize is that if I know a concept but I don’t know the proper terms for it, I probably don’t know the concept as well as I could.  Sure, I can write code all day long.  But, it doesn’t mean I will write the best code that I can.  It just means that I’ll get the job done. But once I spend the time to learn not just the concept, but the words that describe the concept, I’ve become a student of my craft.  I’ve proven that this is more than a job.  I’ve become a true professional.  Anything less and I’ve proven that I’m a really good hack at best. I realize that this may offend some of you.  So, let me soften this.  I’m not saying you are a bad programmer if you don’t know the proper terms for what you are doing.  What I’m saying is you aren’t as good of a programmer as you could be.  And for those of you who might disagree, the question I have to ask is, “how do you know?”  If you are still defending not having to know this, I have to make the assumption that it is because you are happy not knowing the terms.  Meaning you have nothing to compare where you are to where I am proposing that you should be.  Why not try becoming a student of programming and seeing for yourself if what I am saying has any merit or not.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/08/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> Last week, I posted <a href="/7-c-interview-questions-that-weed-out-the-losers/">7 interview questions for C# programmers.</a>  I guess I forgot that people can’t see in my brain.  So, let me be very explicit this time.  The “weed out the losers” questions are meant to do just that.  Weed out people who have absolutely no business even applying for the job. You would be amazed at how many people interview for a job who have all kinds of cool buzzwords on their resume, but when you ask them about it, they know nothing about the subject.  I’m not sure if this is the recruiter who is representing them trying to help them out by beefing up the resume to get them in the door or if they actually do this themselves.  But, as someone who interviews, I have to have a way of making sure the applicant I’m interviewing is worth interviewing in the first place.  Hopefully, I can do this over the phone in less than a half an hour. So, with that said, if your favorite question isn’t on this list, it is probably because it is a question I would save for some future interview. Also, to those of you who may think that a technical interview doesn’t really tell you if the programmer is a good programmer or not, I have this to say… You are right.  And when I was a younger programmer and was being interviewed with technical questions, I felt the same way.  But now that I’m on the other side of the table, I find that way too often, the people who can pass a technical interview are a lot more likely to be good programmers than the ones who can’t. And finally, I would not rule out an applicant because he got a couple of questions wrong, or didn’t answer them exactly the way I expected.  But if couldn’t answer most of them, that would raise a huge red flag! So, here are 7 JavaScript Interview Questions you should ask first.  Otherwise, you may be wasting your time.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-two-ways-you-might-create-an-object-in-JavaScript"><a href="#What-are-two-ways-you-might-create-an-object-in-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="What are two ways you might create an object in JavaScript?"></a>What are two ways you might create an object in JavaScript?</h2><p>This is a pretty simple question if you’ve been using JavaScript.  Shoot, you should even be able to guess at one of the answers.  But, still, in my experience, there are a lot of people who say they are JavaScript programmers who don’t know how to answer this question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the “new” keyword to call a function.</li>
<li><p>Use the open/close curly braces.</p>
<p>var o = {};</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might want to follow up with, “using the new keyword, at what point is the object created?”  But, as far as questions that weed out, I would consider that something that could wait until I’m really interviewing to discover how deep the applicant’s knowledge goes.</p>
<h2 id="How-would-you-create-an-array"><a href="#How-would-you-create-an-array" class="headerlink" title="How would you create an array?"></a>How would you create an array?</h2><p>This is a similar level question to “How do you create an object.”  And yet, there are some who can answer the first who can’t answer this one. While it is possible to create an array with</p>
<p>var myArray = new Array();</p>
<p>It is a long way of creating an array.  One would hope that the answer included using square brackets.</p>
<p>var myArray = [];</p>
<p>Once again, there are other questions we could ask, but since we only want to know that the applicant is worth further investigation, I would leave the array questioning here.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-variable-hoisting"><a href="#What-is-variable-hoisting" class="headerlink" title="What is variable hoisting?"></a>What is variable hoisting?</h2><p>This one is a slightly harder question to answer, and I wouldn’t expect anyone to be able to answer this.  But again, we are trying to get a quick determination of the applicant’s skill level.  How well do they understand the language they claim to know? Variable hoisting is the term that refers to the fact that no matter where a variable is declared in a scope, the JavaScript engine will move that declaration to the top of the scope.  If you declare a variable in the middle of a function, for example and assign a value to it all in one line:</p>
<p>function foo()<br>{<br>    // a bunch of code here<br>    var a = “abc”;<br>}</p>
<p>The code that actually gets run would look like this:</p>
<p>function foo()<br>{<br>    var a;<br>    // a bunch of code<br>    a = “abc”;<br>}</p>
<h2 id="What-are-the-dangers-of-global-variables-and-how-do-you-protect-against-it"><a href="#What-are-the-dangers-of-global-variables-and-how-do-you-protect-against-it" class="headerlink" title="What are the dangers of global variables and how do you protect against it?"></a>What are the dangers of global variables and how do you protect against it?</h2><p>The danger of global variables is that someone else could create a variable with the same name and overwrite the variable you are using.  This is a bad idea in any language. You prevent this in a number of ways.  The most common would be to create one global variable that all of your other variables live in:</p>
<p>var applicationName = {};</p>
<p>And then any time you need to create a global variable, you attach it to that object.</p>
<p>applicationName.myVariable = “abc”;</p>
<p>The other way you can guard against this is by wrapping all of your code in a self-executing function so that any variables that are declared are declared within that function’s scope.</p>
<p>(function(){<br>   var a = “abc”;<br>})();</p>
<p>In reality, you’ll probably end up using both methods.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-you-iterate-through-members-in-a-JavaScript-object"><a href="#How-do-you-iterate-through-members-in-a-JavaScript-object" class="headerlink" title="How do you iterate through members in a JavaScript object?"></a>How do you iterate through members in a JavaScript object?</h2><p>for(var prop in obj){<br>    // bonus points for hasOwnProperty<br>    if(obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)){<br>        // do something here<br>    }<br>}</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-closure"><a href="#What-is-a-closure" class="headerlink" title="What is a closure?"></a>What is a closure?</h2><p>A closure is what allows a function inside the scope of another function to still be able to see the variables declared in the outer scope even after everything else about that scope has disappeared.  Bonus points if they state something about the dangers of using a closure inside of a for/next loop without declaring a variable to hold the current value of the iteration variable.</p>
<h2 id="Describe-your-experience-unit-testing-JavaScript"><a href="#Describe-your-experience-unit-testing-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Describe your experience unit testing JavaScript"></a>Describe your experience unit testing JavaScript</h2><p>Here we are just trying to find out if they’ve even done unit testing with JavaScript.  It is an open ended question with no particular right answer but it should tell you something in the process.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/08/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> So, once again, the place I am currently working has been interviewing for some more programmers and we’ve had to laugh at some of the answers we’ve received on some pretty simple question. For example, in answer to “How do you create an object in JavaScript?”  One applicant responded, “I always use the WHERE keyword.”  What?!!! And that naturally got us all talking about good interview questions.  How can we tell that the applicant is even worth interviewing? The following questions are not meant to be THE interview.  The questions are meant to shorten the interview process by ensuring the applicant has a basic understanding of the language they will be expected to work with. </p>
<h2 id="C-Interview-Questions"><a href="#C-Interview-Questions" class="headerlink" title="C# Interview Questions"></a>C# Interview Questions</h2><h3 id="1-What-is-the-difference-between-an-Object-and-a-Class"><a href="#1-What-is-the-difference-between-an-Object-and-a-Class" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the difference between an Object and a Class?"></a>1. What is the difference between an Object and a Class?</h3><p>This is an object oriented 101 question.  So if you can’t answer this, I might try a few other questions for show, but you’ve probably already been counted out.  The way I always described the difference between the two is that the Class is like a cookie cutter and an Object is like the cookie.  The class defines what the object is going to do, but the object is the thing actually doing the work. A more technical answer would be that the Class defines the object while the Object is the Class active in memory.</p>
<h3 id="2-What-is-“Polymorphism”"><a href="#2-What-is-“Polymorphism”" class="headerlink" title="2. What is “Polymorphism”?"></a>2. What is “Polymorphism”?</h3><p>This is my first stab at making sure you understand the basics of object oriented programming.  Does your answer at least include the concept of virtual functions?  Here is how I explain polymorphism. Polymorphism gets at the idea that you can have a method in a parent class and a method with the same name in a child class.  If the method in the parent class should be marked virtual and the method in the child class should be marked “overrides.”  At runtime, the decision as to which one is called is based on the type of the object that the method is called from.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/polymorphism.html">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/polymorphism.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some might want to include other concepts</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>But historically, polymorphism has been limited to the basic idea of virtual functions and the applicants response should, at the very least, reflect this answer.</p>
<h3 id="3-What-is-the-difference-between-overload-overrides-and-shadows"><a href="#3-What-is-the-difference-between-overload-overrides-and-shadows" class="headerlink" title="3. What is the difference between overload, overrides, and shadows?"></a>3. What is the difference between overload, overrides, and shadows?</h3><p>Again, this is to get at your understanding of object oriented programming generally and the sometimes confusing keywords in the language. - Overloading gets at the concept that you can have multiple methods with the same name hanging off a given class as long as the methods all have a different signature (parameter types), the code is legal. - Overrides is how polymorphism is implemented. - Shadows flips polymorphism on it’s head.  If you mark a method as shadowed using the “new” keyword, then instead of the method getting called based on the object type, the method gets called based on the variable type that is holding the reference to the object. So, give class A is a parent of class B and both have a method foo() and foo() is marked with the shadows keyword.  If you declare a variable of type A and point that variable to an object of type B, when you call foo off that object, A.foo() will be called.</p>

What is the difference between the keyword  “String” and the keyword “string”?"></a>4. What is the difference between the keyword  “String” and the keyword “string”?</h3><p>I work with some pretty sharp guys and even they stumbled on this one.  Do YOU know? When I was teaching C# for a training company, I would say, “The only difference is that ‘string’ turns blue in the editor.”  Of course now that you can configure the editor, that’s not really a good answer.  But you get the point.  Both keywords compile down to the same intermediate language.  Technically, “string” is an alias for “String”.  “String” is the proper class.</p>
<h3 id="5-What-is-“int”-an-alias-for"><a href="#5-What-is-“int”-an-alias-for" class="headerlink" title="5. What is “int” an alias for?"></a>5. What is “int” an alias for?</h3><p>Since we’ve already used the term alias by this point, I’m digging deep to find out just how much you know.  The proper answer is that “int” is an alias for the Int32 type.  I can forgive you if you say “class” but it really isn’t a class.  It is a type.</p>
<h3 id="6-What-is-the-difference-between-a-value-type-and-a-reference-type"><a href="#6-What-is-the-difference-between-a-value-type-and-a-reference-type" class="headerlink" title="6. What is the difference between a value type and a reference type?"></a>6. What is the difference between a value type and a reference type?</h3><p>Once again, I’m trying to find out how well you know what is going on.  Do you just hack at your code until it seems to work, or do you really understand what is happening under the hood? Again, when I was teaching this, the explanation always went something like this: The value of a value type occupies memory on the stack and when you do an assignment from one value type to another the data is copied from one memory location to the other.  Each variable is changed in isolation to the other. A reference type is a variable on the stack that points to memory in the heap that actually holds the value.  When you do an assignment from one reference type to another, only the pointer is copied.  In the end, both variables point to the same location on the heap. If you change the value of a reference type from one variable, the other variable is impacted with the change because it is the same location in memory you are changing. The key part of this answer is that the value of a value type occupies the memory the variable represents and that the value of a reference type is pointed to by the memory that the variable represents.  The stack vs heap issue is secondary and in fact gets clouded by the fact that once you put a value type in a reference type, either by boxing or by including it as a member of a class, the whole stack vs heap question gets quite murky.  But, using stack vs heap as a general way of discussing the main issue is a starting point at the very least.</p>

I doubt most programmers have given this much thought so it is OK if they have to spend some time thinking of the answer. What I’m hoping to hear is that dependencies make code untestable. Simplistic answer?  Maybe.  But the answer to this question, regardless of if it agrees with mine or not, will tell me if they’ve had any experience writing unit tests.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/08/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> I got a question this last week that I answered very briefly but I felt that to answer it completely would take a blog post.  So here’s the blog post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should the author of a piece of code be responsible for more than just unit testing, or does peer review have a play?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loaded question, right?  Obviously, the guy asking this question believes that an author should both unit test AND have peer review.  And I agree.  But to limit the role of a programmer to even those two things is a very narrow view of programming. Then I got to thinking about it and realized that most of what we’d be trying to accomplish with a code review encompasses everything we’d want to include in a list of things a developer is responsible for.  Further, a code review is mostly a review that ensures that 1) the code does what it is supposed to do, and 2) the code is easy to maintain in the future. In other words, all that the word “Peer review” or “Code review” encompasses is largely about code clarity. Code clarity addresses the issue we all have when we pick up a new piece of code.  Can you understand it easily?  I just listened to a <a href="//dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1172">DotNetRocks episode</a> that was all about the fact that we spend most of our time reading code and yet no one is talking about how we might do this better.  One way we can read code better is by writing it more clearly in the first place. Here are 15 ways you can make your code easier to read:</p>
<h2 id="Make-your-code-pretty"><a href="#Make-your-code-pretty" class="headerlink" title="Make your code pretty"></a>Make your code pretty</h2><p>I remember back when I was doing Clipper programming, we had one guy who would always show code that was ready to be printed in a text book.  I mean, regardless of what you had to say about what he had actually coded, the visual presentation of the code was a thing of beauty.  He had us believing that all of his code looked like that.  Then he went to work for some other company and we actually looked at the other code he had written.  It looked just like any other code. But it taught me a lesson.  A lesson I, unfortunately still need to be reminded of.  Pretty code is easier to maintain and implies a lot about the quality of the code.  Just like you wouldn’t go to an interview without wearing a suit because how you dress implies something about how you’ll program, your code should imply the quality by what it looks like before you ever start reading it.</p>
<h2 id="Establish-and-obey-naming-conventions-for-your-code"><a href="#Establish-and-obey-naming-conventions-for-your-code" class="headerlink" title="Establish and obey naming conventions for your code."></a>Establish and obey naming conventions for your code.</h2><p>I’ve written about this before.  Most notably when .NET first came out in the article about <a href="/hungarian-notation-use-what-works-spit-out-the-bones/">Hungarian Notation</a>.  As I point out in that article, not using Hungarian notation doesn’t mean you don’t have any standards.  Sure, you don’t want to prefix all of your integers with a lower case “I”, because you don’t care what kind of number it is.  But it is valuable to prefix a button with “button” so that it is easier to find in your Intellisense, or if you need to search your code for what you named it, it is much easier to find all of the buttons in your code this way. But there is another reason to establish and obey naming conventions.  Once you’ve done this, it makes it easier for everyone who is using those common conventions to read your code. For example, where I work, we have what I consider a very odd naming convention.  All of our POCO classes (we generate this ourselves because we are using DB2) are all UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE_SEPARATED.  And all our properties of POCO collections are named UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE_SEPARATEDs.  It used to drive me crazy, mostly because I use <a href="/resharper">ReSharper</a> religiously and the default rules aren’t setup to handle this odd convention.  But, it is a standard and, I can tell you now, you open a file that is using a POCO and you know you are dealing with a POCO.  No question about it! While I still don’t recommend the practice, I tell you that example because it illustrates how much a coding standard can instantly tell you something about the code you are working on before you ever start reading the code.</p>
<h2 id="Establish-and-obey-a-common-architecture"><a href="#Establish-and-obey-a-common-architecture" class="headerlink" title="Establish and obey a common architecture."></a>Establish and obey a common architecture.</h2><p>One of the biggest problems I have in reading other people’s code is if I can’t understand why they put things where they put them.  But having a common architecture that is easy to explain helps alleviate a lot of this problem.  One of the reasons I like working with frameworks is because much of the time these decisions are already made for you.  For example, just having a simple three tiered architecture that separates the View, Business Rules, and Data Access into different parts of your code can go a long way toward making code easy to read.  Within this basic framework you can layer in Model View Presenter, Model View Controller or any other design patterns.  Follow the mantra, “A place for everything and everything in its place” and your code will be much easier to follow.</p>
<h2 id="Name-objects-as-nouns-methods-as-verbs"><a href="#Name-objects-as-nouns-methods-as-verbs" class="headerlink" title="Name objects as nouns, methods as verbs."></a>Name objects as nouns, methods as verbs.</h2><p>This is so basic that I almost feel like I should have to write this here.  But I still see the principle violate all of the time.  So, here it is.  Obviously, if you aren’t following an object oriented methodology.  Say you are doing Functional or Procedural programming, you’ll need to adapt this rule to your environment.  But for OOP guys and gals.  Stop breaking this rule.  It is a sign of immaturity.</p>
<h2 id="Name-variable-what-they-are"><a href="#Name-variable-what-they-are" class="headerlink" title="Name variable what they are."></a>Name variable what they are.</h2><p>Similarly, stop with the short variable names unless you are using a language that is still so archaic as to require it.  I’ve written about this before.  Twice actually.  <a href="/tags/naming-conventions/">With rants about using i, j and k as variable names</a>.  The point here is that you want to be able to read your code and to do that your code has to tell you something about what you are doing.  Short variable names almost always never assist in code readability.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-include-a-noun-in-your-method"><a href="#Don’t-include-a-noun-in-your-method" class="headerlink" title="Don’t include a noun in your method."></a>Don’t include a noun in your method.</h2><p>This is different from just saying that method should be verbs.  There are a lot of places where I’ve seen code that has a verb AND a noun as a method name.  If you have a method that has both a noun and a verb in it, your class is probably trying to do too much. Wouldn’t it look funny if you had a Person class that had a method in it called FirstNameToLower()?</p>
<h2 id="Establish-a-cyclomatic-complexity-threshold-for-your-methods-and-obey-them-religiously"><a href="#Establish-a-cyclomatic-complexity-threshold-for-your-methods-and-obey-them-religiously" class="headerlink" title="Establish a cyclomatic complexity threshold for your methods and obey them religiously."></a>Establish a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> threshold for your methods and obey them religiously.</h2><p>Cyclomatic complexity takes into account how many statements have to be executed and, most importantly, how many conditionals have to be executed in your code.  The easiest way to reduce cyclomatic complexity is to reduce the number of conditions.  But aside from that, you can make your code much more readable by eliminating nesting where ever possible. One of my favorites is instead of writing code that looks something like this:</p>
<p>void SomeMethod()<br>{<br>   if(x != y)<br>   {<br>      // do stuff here<br>   }<br>}</p>
<p>You can make your code much more readable by writing it like this:</p>
<p>void SomeMethod()<br>{<br>   if(x == y) return;<br>   // do stuff here<br>}</p>
<p>Similarly, instead of nesting when this doesn’t work, as with while statements that contain other while statements, why not create a method for each while statement?</p>
<h2 id="Make-code-“self-documenting”"><a href="#Make-code-“self-documenting”" class="headerlink" title="Make code “self-documenting”"></a>Make code “self-documenting”</h2><p>That is, if you feel your code needs a comment, you probably have violated one or more of the other readability suggestions.  This is not to say that you should never add comments, but they should not be a replacement for readable code.  I generally leave comments for WHY I did something and leave the WHAT I did to the code.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-add-comments-for-things-that-you-can-deduce-by-reading-the-code"><a href="#Don’t-add-comments-for-things-that-you-can-deduce-by-reading-the-code" class="headerlink" title="Don’t add comments for things that you can deduce by reading the code."></a>Don’t add comments for things that you can deduce by reading the code.</h2><p>“This next line increments loopVar by 1” does no one any good and could eventually end up being litter in your code that makes the code harder to read.  Why?  Because it is possible for loopVar to get renamed, or removed and the comment could stick around forever.  Until we get compilers that verify our comments as well as our executable code, referencing variables in comments is a generally bad practice that should be avoided.</p>
<h2 id="Is-the-code-SOLID"><a href="#Is-the-code-SOLID" class="headerlink" title="Is the code SOLID?"></a>Is the code <a href="/pluralsightSOLID">SOLID</a>?</h2><ul>
<li>Single Responsibility of classes</li>
<li>Open/Close Principle</li>
<li>Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
<li>Interface Segregation Principle</li>
<li>Dependency Inversion</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Is-the-code-testable"><a href="#Is-the-code-testable" class="headerlink" title="Is the code testable?"></a>Is the code testable?</h2><p>If you follow all of the rules above, the code should be easy to test.  But, this is something that you should review your code for explicitly.</p>
<h2 id="Will-the-code-fail"><a href="#Will-the-code-fail" class="headerlink" title="Will the code fail?"></a>Will the code fail?</h2><p>Can anyone write code that uses any particular method that would make the method crash, throw an exception, or otherwise do something that was never intended?</p>
<h2 id="Code-duplications"><a href="#Code-duplications" class="headerlink" title="Code duplications."></a>Code duplications.</h2><p>I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty sure I’ve got code that looks practically the same littered throughout my code base.  One of my current goals is to make myself create a new method any time I’m getting ready to copy and paste more than three lines of code.</p>
<h2 id="100-Code-Coverage"><a href="#100-Code-Coverage" class="headerlink" title="100% Code Coverage"></a>100% Code Coverage</h2><p>Assuming you have unit test, do you have 100% code coverage on all of the methods that have a cyclomatic complexity score greater than 1?  I’m talking about code you’ve written.  I’ve written before about <a href="/100-code-coverage/">what code should be tested</a> and what code doesn’t need to be tested.</p>
<h2 id="Learn-the-vocabulary-of-your-language"><a href="#Learn-the-vocabulary-of-your-language" class="headerlink" title="Learn the vocabulary of your language"></a>Learn the vocabulary of your language</h2><p>John Sonmez wrote a very compelling article in 2013 about <a href="//simpleprogrammer.com/2013/04/14/what-makes-code-readable-not-what-you-think/">what makes code readable</a>.  In it he says that just like when we learn to read.  Code that is readable by a senior level developer may not be readable by an entry level developer simply because the entry level developer doesn’t have a firm grasp of the language.  Like John, I’ve been criticized for using the ternary operator because it is too terse.  Not descriptive enough.  Un-readable.  And I’ve always responded that arguing that the syntax isn’t clear is like arguing that a sentence isn’t clear because it uses a word you aren’t familiar with.  The word may actually be the perfect word for what the author is trying to communicate.  Your understanding of that word does not make the writing bad.  It just means the reader has some more learning to do. What else have you found makes your code more readable?  Leave me a comment below.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> For the last two years, about 99% of the work I’ve been doing has been JavaScript programming using EXTjs.  The problems I’ve encountered along the way are primarily related to testing.  Writing unit test using the “MVC Framework” out of the box is nearly impossible, but I did eventually put together an architecture that allows me to do that.  I may blog about that in the future. Today, what I want to offer is how I overcame various hurdles related to testing EXTjs with Selenium.  The first problem nearly everyone encounters when they first use EXTjs is that the views that are created are created dynamically.  If you use the recommended itemId to uniquely identify the elements on the page, you will be left with IDs that are dynamically generated and inconsistent.  That is, just because the ID has one value today doesn’t mean it will have the same value tomorrow.  And since the controls are dynamically created based on what browser is running, XPATH queries aren’t a good solution either.</p>
<h2 id="Custom-FindsBy-attribute"><a href="#Custom-FindsBy-attribute" class="headerlink" title="Custom FindsBy attribute"></a>Custom FindsBy attribute</h2><p>Now, you could solve this problem by creating a different Page Object for each browser and then you’d be able to use XPATH statements to go after the elements.  But, what if you could go after the itemIds directly?  By the Selenium APIs let you create your own selectors.  So, instead of writing your element properties like this:</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using=”someId”)]<br>private IWebElement SomeId{get; [UsedImplicitly]set;}</p>
<p>  You could do something like:</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Custom,<br>    CustomFinderType = typeof(ExtByComponentQuery),<br>    Using = “#someId”)]<br>private IWebElement SomeId{get; [UsedImplicitly]set;}</p>
<p>One of the side effects of using this extension is that you can now find any element using any valid EXTjs selector. So, you are probably wondering what the code looks like to get this all working.  Well here you go:</p>
<p>using System;<br>using System.Collections.Generic;<br>using System.Collections.ObjectModel;<br>using System.Linq;<br>using System.Threading;<br>using OpenQA.Selenium;<br>using OpenQA.Selenium.Internal;</p>
<p>namespace ENT.Supporting<br>{<br>    public class ExtByComponentQuery : By<br>    {<br>        private readonly string _locator;<br>        public ExtByComponentQuery(string locator)<br>        {<br>            _locator = locator;<br>        }</p>
<pre><code>public static ExtByComponentQuery Query(string locator)
{
    if (locator == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(&quot;locator&quot;, 
            @&quot;Cannot find elements when name locator is null.&quot;);
    return new ExtByComponentQuery(locator);
}

public override IWebElement FindElement(ISearchContext context)
{
    var elements = FindElements(context);
    if (elements != null &amp;&amp; elements.Count &gt; 0)
        return elements.First();
    Console.WriteLine(@&quot;returning null from FindElement&quot;);
    return null;
}

public override ReadOnlyCollection&lt;IWebElement&gt; FindElements(ISearchContext context)
{
    var script = string.Format(
</code></pre><p>@”var r= Ext.ComponentQuery.query(‘{0}’);<br>var rarray = [];<br>for(e = 0;e &lt; r.length;e++)<br>{ {<br>    if(r[e].getEl() !== undefined)<br>        rarray.push(r[e].getEl().dom);<br>}}<br>return rarray;”,_locator.Replace(“‘“,”\\’”));<br>            var javaScriptExecutor = context as IJavaScriptExecutor ??<br>                                     ((IWrapsDriver)context).WrappedDriver as IJavaScriptExecutor;<br>            if (javaScriptExecutor == null) return null;<br>            object scriptReturn = null;<br>            for (var i = 0; i &lt; 120 &amp;&amp; scriptReturn == null; i++)<br>            {<br>                if ( i &gt; 0) Thread.Sleep(1000);<br>                scriptReturn = javaScriptExecutor.ExecuteScript(script);<br>            }<br>            return scriptReturn == null ? null : new ReadOnlyCollection<iwebelement>((IList<iwebelement>)scriptReturn);<br>        }<br>    }<br>}</iwebelement></iwebelement></p>
<p>The constructor gets passed the selector string that is passed with the Using parameter in the attribute.  The FindElements() finds all of the elements that match the selector.  The FindElement() returns the first of all that it found. You can either use this code as part of the FindsBy attribute or you can use it stand alone by calling the static Query method. You’ll see that the bulk of the functionality is just the same JavaScript code you would normally write in EXTjs.</p>
<h2 id="Get-an-element’s-Value"><a href="#Get-an-element’s-Value" class="headerlink" title="Get an element’s Value"></a>Get an element’s Value</h2><p>One of the other problems you are likely to run into is retrieving the current value of an element.  This is because many of the controls that EXT provides to us do not use the INPUT item’s value to keep track of the value.  So, for this, and other similar scenarios, I wrote an extension method.</p>
<p>public static string GetExtValue(this IWebElement element)<br>{<br>    IWebElement realElement = null;<br>    if (element as IWrapsDriver == null)<br>    {<br>        var e = element as IWrapsElement;<br>        if (e != null) realElement = e.WrappedElement;<br>    }<br>    else<br>    {<br>         realElement = element;<br>    }</p>
<pre><code>if (realElement == null) return null;

var wrapsDriver = (IWrapsDriver)realElement;
var id = realElement.GetAttribute(&quot;id&quot;);
var driver = wrapsDriver.WrappedDriver;
var val = ((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(
    @&quot;return Ext.getCmp(arguments\[0\]).getRawValue();&quot;,
    id);
if (val == null)
{
    return string.Empty;
}
return val.ToString();
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>What you’ll want to pay attention to here is the code at the top. The if(element as IWrapsDriver) stuff is testing to see if we have the real element or if we have a proxy to the element that was created by the FindsBy attribute.  If the element is of type IWrapsDriver, we have the proxy and so need to go grab the real element before we continue.  Once we are sure we are working with a real element, we can use JavaScript to grab the raw value from EXTjs.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Modifications"><a href="#Other-Modifications" class="headerlink" title="Other Modifications"></a>Other Modifications</h2><p>I found that there were other modifications that I needed to make.  So I’ve also created extension methods that select items from dropdown list, Click radio buttons and checkboxes until they are actually selected (or actually unselected).  I found that they don’t always select or unselect on the first click for some reason.  Also, if your code is enabling and disabling stuff and you want to check for that, you’ll need to write some extensions to handle that because EXT uses a mask to disable.  The best way of determining if something is enabled or disabled is by writing JavaScript to ask EXT if it is enabled or disabled.  There are other things I’ve written that are somewhat project specific.  But if you run into a problem, your best bet is to create an extension method to go after EXT code directly.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I generally hate using the framework I’m using to test my code from EXTjs.  And whenever possible, I’ll look for a way to go after the elements using plain old selectors and the built in Selenium code.  But that isn’t always practical in this case.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> I had this thought this past week that we tend to believe that if we are in motion, we are accomplishing something.  That being busy somehow equals being productive.  And then I started thinking about how this is almost universal.  It doesn’t just impact how we program, which I’ll get to eventually, but it impacts all of our life.</p>
<h2 id="Let-Me-Illustrate"><a href="#Let-Me-Illustrate" class="headerlink" title="Let Me Illustrate"></a>Let Me Illustrate</h2><p>Have you ever driven to some location and had your favorite GPS system route you multiple ways?  How many of you take the route that is, according to your GPS, longer, just because the roads are 65mph instead of 45mph?  Or an even better example.  You hit a traffic jam and, even though ever indication is that you’ll be out of the traffic in a few minutes, you take an alternate route simply because the traffic is moving on that other road.  In both cases you probably know that you won’t get to your destination any faster, in fact you may get to your destination slower, but you still opt to take the moving route instead of the one that isn’t moving or is moving relatively slowly.  I’ve even heard people say… shoot I’ve even said… “I want to take this route because it moves faster.”  I like FEELING like I’m getting to my destination faster even if the reality is that I’m not. And then there is the issue of your job.  How many of you have to look busy for your peers to think that you ARE busy?  But as programmers, how true is that?  Unless you do some kind of unskilled labor, I doubt it is true of most people who work.  And yet, because we are all paid by the hour (yes, even those of you who are salaried are still trading hours for dollars) there is a perception that, somehow, if we are not in motion, we are not really working.  But is that true? I remember hearing a story about a programmer who spent half his day “staring at the ceiling” who was twice as productive as any of his peers.  Why is that?  Because he spent half his day thinking about the problem before he ever started writing a line of code. I remember back in the day when I was coding on 8088 computers, a compile and link cycle could take up to 10 minutes.  Because I recompile and test every time I’m made a runnable change, I had a lot of 10 minute breaks.  I used this time to think about the problem I was working on.  This was not intentional, it just happened naturally.  I think it made me more productive than if I were just churning code all day long at the speed our computers work today. And then there is this side project I’m working on.  I tend to work on it a half hour at a time as I have time.  Between my main gig that takes up 40 hours a week, and some side gigs that I have, I have a very small amount of time to work on this project.  Some days I don’t work on it simply because I’m too tired.  But sometimes, even when I’m not sitting in front of my computer, I’ll sit on my sofa doing nothing and think about the project.  It is in those times that I figure out where I want to take the project next, or how to solve a problem I’ve run into.  That time thinking, even though there is no motion, has made the resulting code that much better.</p>
<h2 id="The-Fallacy-of-Motion-and-Testing"><a href="#The-Fallacy-of-Motion-and-Testing" class="headerlink" title="The Fallacy of Motion and Testing"></a>The Fallacy of Motion and Testing</h2><p>I’m sure you saw this coming, but one has to ask, is it the fallacy of motion that prevents us from testing our code? At my main gig, I have to admit, I’m bored.  There are a lot of reasons for this.  But one of them is that I spend a lot of time waiting for integrations tests to run to verify that my code is still working.  To be clear, I have way more unit test than integration test at this point.  But with the changes I’m currently making to the system, I’m more likely to find issues via the integration tests than I am from the unit tests. Compare this to a project I’m working on for another client where I’m primarily writing new code.  I’m a lot less bored.  The day zips by.  I FEEL more productive. And yet, the degree of certainty I have that the code I wrote for my main gig works as I designed it to work is a lot higher than the code I’m currently writing because I have more tests. This past week those tests actually showed me that my change wasn’t working entirely the way I wanted it to.  I probably would not have found it any other way.  I’m not even sure the people testing my code would have found it.  They aren’t those kind of testers.  And so I’ve proven to myself one more time that testing, while it feels slower, really is not just the right thing to do, but ultimately the faster thing to do. Think about what would have happened if I didn’t have these tests in place.  I would have released the code, eventually the bug would have revealed itself, and I would be left scrambling to fix the bug.  As it is, I was able to fix the bug in a somewhat leisurely manner because I found it early. And yet, I don’t FEEL productive.  As much as I’m convinced that Test Driven Development is the right way to go, I still struggle with this Fallacy of Motion.</p>
<h2 id="We-Don’t-Have-Time-to-Test"><a href="#We-Don’t-Have-Time-to-Test" class="headerlink" title="We Don’t Have Time to Test"></a>We Don’t Have Time to Test</h2><p>I heard this again this past week.  “When you are working on a project with a tight deadline, you can’t always test because you don’t have enough time.” What?! Is this the Fallacy of Motion at work again? I would argue that it is precisely BECAUSE you are working under a tight deadline that you NEED to write test. Think about this, you have this tight deadline.  Great.  So you are not going to think clearly.  You are going to rush.  You will write incomplete code.  Your methods won’t verify input parameters.  You’ll have null pointer exceptions.  Your code will do what it is supposed to do, but will it not do what it shouldn’t do?  How will you know?  And who is going to catch the bug? Well we know the answer to that last question.  The people using your code will catch the bug.  This will make you look like an idiot.  You are because it is something that should have been caught.  It will also mean that you’ll need to track down the problem, fix the problem, and re-deploy the software.  And this is faster?  Faster than what?! Of course, “We don’t have time to do it right, but we always have time to do it over.”</p>
<h2 id="Slow-and-Steady"><a href="#Slow-and-Steady" class="headerlink" title="Slow and Steady"></a>Slow and Steady</h2><p>So, slow down.  Do things right.  Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare.  The race doesn’t always go to the fastest but the one who is steady and persistent.  The one who doesn’t cut corners.  The one who consistently produces solid code.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/ppl-kid-044.jpg" alt="ppl-kid-044" title="ppl-kid-044"> This probably doesn’t happen all that often, but this last week I came across the need to know which browser I was running my selenium test against.  I figured that buried deep in the object structure of Selenium, there MUST be a way of finding out what browser I was currently running.  As it turns out, I was right.  The situation that caused this requirement is that the place where I’m currently writing most of my code is upgrading all of the Firefox browsers.  I was asked to make sure the code we were running still works with the new browser.  When I did, I found that some of my tests broke even though the test itself still succeeds when it is run manually.  In fact, they only broke when running against this new version of Firefox. Now to be clear, this isn’t really a Firefox problem.  In fact, the new version of Firefox runs my test the way I would expect.  It is the current version of IE and the older version of Firefox that we were running in combination with EXTjs 4.2 that was a problem.  So, now I’m in a situation where I need to run my work around for everything except for this new version of Firefox. You see, we have several dropdown list.  To select an item from the list, I cursor down until the correct item is found.  My old implementation actually needed to cursor down twice.  The first time made the list display and kept the current item selected.  The second down arrow selected the next item.  The tab key keeps that item as the selected one.  The new version of Firefox only requires one down arrow and a tab to do the same thing. Since we have multiple dropdowns that behave the same way, I made this code an extension method, so I only have to do it once.  The other thing I’m doing that makes this work is that I’m proxying the elements using the FindsBy attribute.</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using = “someIdHere”), CacheLookup]<br>private IWebElement SomePropertyName<br>    { get; [UsedImplicitly] set; }</p>
<p>  Under the hood this creates a proxy to the real element.  What we need access to is the Driver object that this element is using to get at the element on the browser.  I do that by going after the element’s WrappedDriver property.  In most code you’ll see this cast to an IWrapsDriver interface.  But it is actually pointing to a RemoteWebDriver object.  If we cast the type to that, we can then go after the Capabilities object which will give us access to the BrowserName. And so, my resulting code looks something like this:</p>
<p>var keyDown = Keys.Down + Keys.Down;<br>var wrapsDriver = ((IWrapsDriver)(element)).WrappedDriver;<br>if (wrapsDriver != null)<br>{<br>    if (wrapsDriver.GetType() == typeof(RemoteWebDriver) &amp;&amp;<br>        ((RemoteWebDriver)wrapsDriver)<br>        .Capabilities.BrowserName ==  “firefox”)<br>     {<br>        keyDown = Keys.Down;<br>     }<br>}</p>
<p>Which allows me to use the keyDown variable where ever I need to key down to select an item from the list. The element variable above represents the proxy element created by the FindsBy attribute.  The code is in the extension method that I mentioned previously, so it is actually the parameter that got passed into the extension method.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> Over the past ten years, I’ve successfully implemented various types of screen scraping in order to provide data to my clients.  Most of these implementations have involved accessing HTML and parsing out the data we needed for the web application. My latest implementation of this made use of the <a href="//htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/">HTML Agility Pack</a> and managed to incorporate the e-Labels For Education site into the Labels For Education site.  (No links, because the e-Labels program is being phased out.) Recently, I’ve been spending a lot of times on some site doing the same thing over and over again.  But most of the sites I visit now implement some kind of AJAX so that doing a simple web request to a page without also loading and parsing the JavaScript ends up giving me a page with no useful data at all.  Unlike the work I’ve done in the past where this was sufficient. This, combined with my recent work implementing Jasmine unit test for JavaScript and running them in the PhantomJS headless browser has had me thinking, wouldn’t it be great if I could do similar kinds of screen scraping, or even browser automation, but use something like an embedded version of PhantomJS to get the work done. Well, do a search for “embedded PhantomJS for .NET” or something similar and you’ll find that that isn’t possible.  At least not yet. But there is a viable alternative.  Actually there are a couple of viable alternative.  But they all end up using the Google Chromium browser API.  The implementation I ended up using is <a href="//github.com/cefsharp">CefSharp</a>.  Mostly because this is what is available from NuGet. What follows are some of the tricks I learned along the way.</p>
<h2 id="Installing-Chromium"><a href="#Installing-Chromium" class="headerlink" title="Installing Chromium"></a>Installing Chromium</h2><p>The first thing you’ll need to do once you have a project started, is that you’ll need to install the Chromium DLLs.  In the NuGet package manager, do a search for CefSharp.  This will bring up a list of plugins, you’ll want to install CefSharp.OffScreen and CefSharp.Common (I’m assuming you want to do off-screen automation here.)  The version I am working with is version 39. What I found difficult to figure out next was how to actually use the library.</p>
<h2 id="Get-It-Initialized"><a href="#Get-It-Initialized" class="headerlink" title="Get It Initialized"></a>Get It Initialized</h2><p>You’ll want to initialize the library before you use it.  The following lines will do that.  I just put this as early in my code as possible.</p>
<p>var settings = new CefSettings<br>    {LogSeverity = LogSeverity.Verbose};<br>settings.CefCommandLineArgs.Add(“no-proxy-server”, “1”);</p>
<p>Cef.OnContextInitialized = ()<br>    => Cef.SetCookiePath(“cookies”, true);</p>
<p>if (!Cef.Initialize(settings, shutdownOnProcessExit: false,<br>    performDependencyCheck: true))<br>{<br>     throw new Exception(“Unable to Initialize Cef”);<br>}</p>
<p>If you want to use a proxy server, you’ll need to look up the documentation for how to set the proxy server. The Cef.SetCookiePath sets the location of your cookie file.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-The-Browser-“Window”"><a href="#Creating-The-Browser-“Window”" class="headerlink" title="Creating The Browser “Window”"></a>Creating The Browser “Window”</h2><p>Now that you have this all set, you can use the ChromiumWebBrowser class to create a browser window.  Since the browser is disposable, you’ll want to either wrap the code in a using() statement or you’ll want to make sure you dispose of the browser object when you are done. You’ll want to set a few things on the browser object next.</p>
<p>browser.BrowserSettings<br>    .FileAccessFromFileUrlsAllowed = true;<br>browser.BrowserSettings<br>    .UniversalAccessFromFileUrlsAllowed = true;<br>browser.BrowserSettings<br>    .WebSecurityDisabled = true;</p>
<p>And then you’ll want to wait for the browser to initialize. Now the code I was given for this looks like this:</p>
<p>public static Task WaitForBrowserToInitialize(this ChromiumWebBrowser browser)<br>{<br>    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();</bool></p>
<pre><code>EventHandler handler = null;
handler = (sender, args) =&gt;
{
    browser.BrowserInitialized -= handler;
    tcs.TrySetResult(true);
};
browser.BrowserInitialized += handler;

return tcs.Task;
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>You’ll recognize this as an extension method.  What it is doing is waiting for the BrowserInitialized event to fire and then telling the task it can return.  This works great the first time you use it, but I found that when I created a new browser “window” the initialization happened so quickly that this was unreliable.  I’ve replaced this code with the more reliable version below.</p>
<p>public static Task WaitForBrowserToInitialize<br>    (this ChromiumWebBrowser browser)<br>{<br>    while (!Browser.IsBrowserInitialized)<br>    {<br>        await Task.Delay(100);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>It does the same thing.  It is just more reliable.</p>
<h2 id="Load-a-Page"><a href="#Load-a-Page" class="headerlink" title="Load a Page"></a>Load a Page</h2><p>Everything else is pretty straight forward.  To load a web page:</p>
<p>public static Task LoadUrl(this ChromiumWebBrowser browser,string url)<br>{<br>    browser.Load(url);<br>    return browser.WaitForPage();<br>}</p>
<p>That WaitForPage() method looks like this:</p>
<p>public static Task WaitForPage(this ChromiumWebBrowser browser)<br>{<br>    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();<br>    EventHandler<navstatechangedeventargs> handler = null;<br>    handler = (sender, args) =&gt;<br>    {<br>        //Wait for while page to finish loading not<br>        // just the first frame<br>        if (!args.IsLoading)<br>        {<br>            browser.NavStateChanged -= handler;<br>            tcs.TrySetResult(true);<br>        }<br>    };</navstatechangedeventargs></bool></p>
<pre><code>browser.NavStateChanged += handler;
return tcs.Task;
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<h2 id="Get-Data-Out"><a href="#Get-Data-Out" class="headerlink" title="Get Data Out"></a>Get Data Out</h2><p>If you need to get data out of the page, you can use GetSourceAsync();</p>
<p>var source = await browser.GetSourceAsync();</p>
<p>or you can use JavaScript to get at the DOM using</p>
<p>await EvaluateScriptAsync(javaScriptCodeHere);</p>
<p>  Note, you can also use EvaluateScriptAsync to do things like clicking buttons, scrolling the window and a lot of other useful things.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/06/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> As I was sharing my LinkedIn tips with a co-worker this past week that made me realize that I’ve accumulated an incredible amount of knowledge about using LinkedIn that I should probably share.  Things that aren’t obvious to the typical user. But first, I have to ask a question. Why are you on LinkedIn? From my discussions with many of my peers, I think many of you are on LinkedIn simply because you think you should be.  But your behavior on LinkedIn makes me believe you would rather not be on LinkedIn at all.  Maybe you should delete your account? Why do I say this?  Because many of you have not spent the time to even get the basics of your account setup.  And even if you have, you have everything set so that only your first degree connections can find you.  This isn’t going to help you at all.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Be-On-LinkedIn"><a href="#Why-Be-On-LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="Why Be On LinkedIn?"></a>Why Be On LinkedIn?</h2><p>So, let’s start at the beginning.  Why should you be on LinkedIn in the first place? There are two main reasons to be on LinkedIn.  The first reason is because you want to be found when someone needs the thing it is that you do.  The second is so that you can find someone when you or your organization need to hire a new employee.  Everything you do on LinkedIn should be focused on those two goals.  This goes double if you have a particularly rare skill.</p>
<h2 id="How-LinkedIn-Works"><a href="#How-LinkedIn-Works" class="headerlink" title="How LinkedIn Works"></a>How LinkedIn Works</h2><p>I don’t mean, how you set it up.  There are other sites and books that talk about this.  What I’m talking about is the internals.  What you need to know that will influence how you setup your LinkedIn account. You see, there is a whole other section of LinkedIn for recruiters.  This section allows the recruiters to check out your profile based on the jobs they are looking for.  In fact, LinkedIn has made this easy for them by looking at the jobs the recruiter is trying to fill and suggesting candidates to the recruiter based on those jobs.  They also get to associate notes with your profile and see when you’ve made a change to your profile.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Forget-About-External-Search-Engines"><a href="#Don’t-Forget-About-External-Search-Engines" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Forget About External Search Engines"></a>Don’t Forget About External Search Engines</h2><p>One of the best kept secrets of LinkedIn is that you have to use LinkedIn to find people on LinkedIn.  But if I were looking for someone on LinkedIn, I would use a regular search engine.  It isn’t that hard to find people I’m looking for by using the following google search string:</p>
<p>site:linkedin.com inurl:/pub/ -inurl:/vsearch/<br>    -inurl:/dir/ -inurl:/company/ [keywords here]</p>
<p>This would be all on one line.  I’ve just wrapped it here to make it easy to read. This search tells Google to search the site linkedin.com for the keywords I’ve listed in [keywords here] that have “/pub/” in the url and don’t have “/vsearch/”, “/dir/” or “/company/” in the url.  This will bring up a list of people with the keywords listed on their publicly visible profile.</p>
<h2 id="LinkedIn-Tips"><a href="#LinkedIn-Tips" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn Tips"></a>LinkedIn Tips</h2><h3 id="Get-a-real-photograph-for-your-profile-picture"><a href="#Get-a-real-photograph-for-your-profile-picture" class="headerlink" title="Get a real photograph for your profile picture"></a>Get a real photograph for your profile picture</h3><p>OK, technically, this won’t help you get found any better.  But I need to start some place and this is the easiest change to make and it will make a difference as we proceed through the tip list.  A real photograph tells me you “get” LinkedIn.  It tells me you are serious about your LinkedIn presence.  This photo should almost always be a picture of you that is as much of your face as you can make fit in the square they give you.  This is otherwise known as a “head shot”. At this point, I have almost 1000 connections.  I’ve seen a lot of profile pictures.  Here are some common mistakes I see.</p>
<ul>
<li>The picture o the person is tiny relative to the space they’ve been given.</li>
<li>The person looks bored.</li>
<li>The person put up a group picture, like they would have done on Facebook. This should be a picture of you alone.</li>
<li>The person put up a drawing of themselves.  (This may be OK if you are a designer. But if you are a programmer, not so much.)</li>
<li>The person put up some kind of Logo.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Make-sure-your-profile-is-filled-out-completely"><a href="#Make-sure-your-profile-is-filled-out-completely" class="headerlink" title="Make sure your profile is filled out completely."></a>Make sure your profile is filled out completely.</h3><p>Make sure you fill out the skills section.  In fact, the skills you have should show up not only in the skills section, but also in the summary, your work titles, and your work descriptions.  It is the skills that people are going to use to find you. When you fill out the skills section, make sure you use skills that LinkedIn recognizes.  These are the skills people will be more likely to find you by.  While you might be awesome at “managing people” that’s probably not how people are going to search for you.  Generally they want to know what tools you know how to use.  Yeah, I know that’s a lot like searching for a painter who can use red paint instead of blue paint.  But that’s how it seems to work. This leads me to your summary.  I’ve seen all kinds of advice about this.  I had one “Social Media Expert” tell me my summary was too technical.  And it might be.  But once again, it is the technical details that most people are looking for.  I put a link to a less technical version of what I do at the beginning of my summary, but in general, I think it is best to summarize the same information you would put in the skills area.  Check out <a href="//www.linkedin.com/in/davembush">my profile</a> to see what I mean. As for the rest of your profile, fill out everything until LinkedIn says you are an “All-Star”.  And then keep adding information.  The more information you add, the easier it will be to find you and when you are found, the more valuable you will seem.</p>
<h3 id="Be-Visible"><a href="#Be-Visible" class="headerlink" title="Be Visible"></a>Be Visible</h3><p>I mentioned this above, but this is a major tip that most people don’t understand.  Hopefully you are beginning to see that the main trick to making LinkedIn work for you is that you need to make your profile visible to as many people as possible.  Several of my other tips are going to circle back on this theme as well.  The main thing you should do to become visible is to make your entire profile publicly visible.  This will make your profile easier to find from regular search engines as well as making it easier to search from 2nd and 3rd degree connections.</p>
<h3 id="Be-Easy-to-Contact"><a href="#Be-Easy-to-Contact" class="headerlink" title="Be Easy to Contact"></a>Be Easy to Contact</h3><p>Yes, yes.  Spam is a problem.  But, most of the time the spam filters do a pretty good job of keeping the spam out.  At least they do for me.  Put your phone number and/or your email on your profile some place that is easy to see.  I’ve placed my contact information at the top of my summary because that is as far at the top of the page as I can get it.</p>
<h3 id="Make-Connections"><a href="#Make-Connections" class="headerlink" title="Make Connections"></a>Make Connections</h3><p>As much as LinkedIn would like to think of itself as a way of building relationships and networking, it isn’t.  I’ve probably shattered your entire perception of the world.  If you want to manage networking relationships, get a CRM program.  If you want to make sure you can get found easily, connect to other people in your industry on LinkedIn. Connecting is why we’ve placed our email address in our profile.  This makes it easy for people to connect to us when LinkedIn ask for an email address. Now, you might ask, why do I need more connections than the people I actually know? Because when someone searches on LinkedIn, the results they see are not ALL of the results that are possible.  LinkedIn only searches your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree connections as well as any people in any of the groups you are a member of.  The more people you are connected to, the more likely you are to be found when someone is searching for your skill set. There are two ways you can connect.  The aggressive way and the passive way.  You can use both and put this on steroids. The aggressive way is to look through your “people you may know” list, which you can get to using the LinkedIn app, or by following this URL, <a href="//www.linkedin.com/people/pymk" title="https://www.linkedin.com/people/pymk">https://www.linkedin.com/people/pymk</a>.  Skip everyone who just has the default “shadow” image.  Look for people who look like they may have skills related to yours.  When you find one, right click the image and open in another tab or window to view the profile without losing the list.  If the profile still looks like someone who is related to your skills, go back to the “people you may know” page and click connect.  Most people don’t know that you do not need an email address if they show up in the people you may know list. You can also use LinkedIn search to find people.  I would only use search to get things going if you need to.  But if you use search for this, you will run out of searches pretty quickly so don’t rely on search. What I’ve found is that most people will connect with me if I ask.  I’ve had a few people who have asked me why I’ve asked for a connection.  When they ask, I tell them, “You and I have related skills and I was hoping to connect to mutually enhance our ability to be found on LinkedIn.” The passive alternative is to view profiles.  You’ll have to view A LOT of profiles but eventually, one of those people will ask you for a connection. Finally, accept connections from anyone who ask regardless of what industry they are in or what skills they have.  The last I heard, LinkedIn allows you to have up to 30,000 connections.  Once you get that many connections, you may want to go through your connections and prune them, but until you get there, more connections mean you can get found easier.  If you find out that your connection is a jerk, you can always <a href="//help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/49/~/removing-a-connection">disconnect</a>. Something I’d like to add to my routine.  But, you really should spend the extra time to at least thank the person who connected with you, either in response to your connection or because they connected to you first.  It just shows you aren’t a machine and adds a few more “Nice Guy” points to the transaction.</p>
<h3 id="Join-Groups"><a href="#Join-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Join Groups"></a>Join Groups</h3><p>As I mentioned above, LinkedIn searches the people in the groups you are a part of when someone does a search.  It also uses this list for the “People You May Know” list that it presents to you.  So the more relevant groups you are a part of, the better. The one set of relevant groups that may not be so obvious are the groups for recruiters.  Since you probably want recruiters to find you, you should join at least one of the recruiter groups.</p>
<h3 id="Get-Noticed"><a href="#Get-Noticed" class="headerlink" title="Get Noticed"></a>Get Noticed</h3><p>This is something I’ve only started to recognize as I’ve work on my own profile.  But the more popular you look to LinkedIn, the higher you show up in the search results, and it would seem the external search engines as well.  I think profile views really matter to LinkedIn.  They can track this and they do have some idea of how often your profile is being viewed.  It only makes sense that they would use this as a way to rank the search results. Aside from getting profile views because you asked for a connection or profile views because you’ve viewed other people’s profiles, the other thing you can do is that you can post relevant content as a LinkedIn status.  If your LinkedIn home page looks anything like mine, you probably have a lot of articles and links posted that look very business related and very few that look like anything you would read. So what do we post here?  Since my major focus is Test Driven Development, C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript, Agile and Scrum, I tend to post links relevant to those areas.  Occasionally one of those links will get re-shared. Don’t forget to view the profile of people you are already a first degree connection with.  If nothing else, it will remind them that you exist.  It may also generate a profile view. My final tip here may be slightly controversial, but here it goes. For the most part, the whole voting up skills on LinkedIn is a joke.  We all know that we can vote up someone we know nothing about.  It is basically meaningless.  Yeah, I know all that.  And frankly, I don’t care.  Because I have a theory that while we don’t care and recruiters don’t care both LinkedIn and the external search engines do.  So what you want to do is you want to go vote up people with skills that match the skills on your profile.  Why?  Because this is going to generate a link back to your profile from their profile and the anchor text is going to be a keyword you want to rank for. I may be totally wrong about how this works, but at the very least, this may generate a profile view which LinkedIn has already indicated it does pay attention to. Well, there you go.  My complete brain dump of LinkedIn Tips.  Do you have any other suggestions?  Leave them in the comments.  We are all learning together. Oh, and don’t forget to <a href="//www.linkedin.com/in/davembush">connect with me on LinkedIn</a>.  </p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/06/spider.jpg" alt="spider" title="spider"> It amazes me how rare the skill of debugging software is.  It is even more amazing to me that after programming for over 27 years now, I still have trouble with this.  So, as a checklist for myself, and as a possible help to others along the way, I offer you “How to Debug Your Code” </p>
<h2 id="Is-It-Plugged-In-Is-It-Turned-On"><a href="#Is-It-Plugged-In-Is-It-Turned-On" class="headerlink" title="Is It Plugged In?  Is It Turned On?"></a>Is It Plugged In?  Is It Turned On?</h2><p>Another way of stating this is, “Validate your assumptions.”  I learned this phrase while I was traveling with a high school music group as a sound tech.  I was one of two guys who was responsible for making sure the sound equipment got from one site to the other and got setup at each site and was ready to go in time for the group to practice at least once before the performed. The thing with sound equipment is, there are lots of connections.  Lots of places to miss.  There were many times that we would set everything up and test it all out and there would be no sound, or partial sound.  I’m ashamed to tell you how many hours we wasted tracking the problem down only to find that something wasn’t connected.  An amp wasn’t turned on.  A plug had come out of the wall.  Cables had become disconnected. And the same sort of thing happens with our code.  You deploy code to the wrong directory and wonder why it isn’t showing up in the browser.  You deploy code to the right directory, but you forgot to get it from version control before you did.</p>
<h2 id="Read-the-Error-Message"><a href="#Read-the-Error-Message" class="headerlink" title="Read the Error Message"></a>Read the Error Message</h2><p>This is especially true with .NET but even when all you have is an error code, the error message is useful. In .NET, when you get an error message, it all but tells you what line of code you need to fix.  And even if you don’t understand the error.  You can copy and paste the error into a search engine and you are likely to come up with multiple possible solutions.  Even if all you have is an error code.</p>
<h2 id="Sometimes-the-Error-Message-Is-Hidden"><a href="#Sometimes-the-Error-Message-Is-Hidden" class="headerlink" title="Sometimes the Error Message Is Hidden"></a>Sometimes the Error Message Is Hidden</h2><p>I was just working on some code last night after putting in a very long day.  My code wasn’t working so I finally decided to pull up the debugger.  In this case, the code was JavaScript and I’m running it in Chrome because what I’m writing is a Chrome plugin.  When I finally loaded the plugin with the debugger active, it was then that I saw the console log message telling me that my variable wasn’t defined.  Talk about stupid mistakes.  My variable was code I meant to enter as a string, but because I didn’t put quotes around it, the JavaScript engine saw it as an undefined variable.</p>
<h2 id="Run-the-Debugger"><a href="#Run-the-Debugger" class="headerlink" title="Run the Debugger"></a>Run the Debugger</h2><p>Once I’ve eliminated the obvious, the next thing is to pull out the debugger and set break points.  Now, this can be tedious.  How many times have you decided to step over when you should have stepped in?  Arrrgh.  Now I have to start over again. Well, here’s how I speed things up. At the top level function.  I initially step over until I find out what line is causing the problem.  If you have an exception that is being thrown, this is easy to do because you just have to wait for the exception.  If you are getting a wrong answer, it may be a bit more difficult because you’ll have to verify your expected results along the way.  But the point is, you need to find out what line is throwing things off or you will be there all day, stepping through code one line at a time. Once you know which line in that function is causing trouble, you step into that line on the next run and step over each line in the lower level function until you find out what line is causing a problem there. Rinse, lather, repeat, until you find the problem.</p>
<h2 id="Step-In-To-Libraries"><a href="#Step-In-To-Libraries" class="headerlink" title="Step In To Libraries"></a>Step In To Libraries</h2><p>This goes back to validating your assumptions, but I call it out here separately because we never think that we’ve made an assumption about something that is supposed to be a “black box” when in fact, we have. Back in the day when I was doing a lot of Visual C++ coding, I learned a lot about how MFC worked by stepping into the MFC code.  So much so that I became the expert in my office regarding fixing C++/MFC related bugs. Today I’m doing a lot of JavaScript coding.  For the last two years I’ve actually done more JavaScript than C#.  Specifically, I’m writing a lot of EXTjs code.  The thing about EXTjs is that the framework is pretty complex.  I would argue too complex.  But that’s another post.  What I want to point out here is that I’ve fixed a lot of issues with my EXTjs code by stepping into the EXTjs framework code, as painful as that was, to find out why my code was behaving the way it was.</p>
<h2 id="The-Search-Engines-Are-Your-Friends"><a href="#The-Search-Engines-Are-Your-Friends" class="headerlink" title="The Search Engines Are Your Friends"></a>The Search Engines Are Your Friends</h2><p>This one should be obvious.  But, unfortunately it isn’t. The hardest part about searching is trying to figure out what other people may have used to describe the problem so that you can find the answer that is just sitting out there waiting for you.  I’m convinced that as intelligent as the search engines have become, using them is still a kind of art.</p>
<h2 id="Explain-the-Problem-to-a-Co-Worker"><a href="#Explain-the-Problem-to-a-Co-Worker" class="headerlink" title="Explain the Problem to a Co-Worker"></a>Explain the Problem to a Co-Worker</h2><p>You would be amazed at how often the act of describing a problem to someone else brings the obvious solution to light.  If you’ve ever done this, you know that often, in the middle of describing the problem, you’ll says, “… oh, never mind.  I know what the problem is now.” Which leads to my alternative solutions…</p>
<h2 id="Explain-the-Problem-to-Your-Coffee-Cup"><a href="#Explain-the-Problem-to-Your-Coffee-Cup" class="headerlink" title="Explain the Problem to Your Coffee Cup"></a>Explain the Problem to Your Coffee Cup</h2><p>Why?   Because it isn’t your co-worker who helped you solve the problem when you explained it to him.  It was the act of explaining it.  Once you’ve articulated the problem well enough to explain it to someone else, that act actually often hands you the solution.</p>
<h2 id="Step-Away-For-a-While"><a href="#Step-Away-For-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Step Away For a While"></a>Step Away For a While</h2><p>I don’t know why it is, but for some reason, we seem to think that if we aren’t coding, we aren’t working.  But you can’t work non-stop as a programmer for 4 – 8 hours without taking a break.  And banging your head against a bug when you’ve already done that for 15 minutes probably isn’t going to produce any better results if you do it for another 4 hours. Yeah, you may try a bunch of stuff.  You may look busy.  But the fact of the matter is, you might be better off finding something else to do for an hour or so and then coming back to the problem once you’re brain has had a rest from it. Well, those are my tips for now.  What tips do you have?  Leave them in the comments.  </p>
