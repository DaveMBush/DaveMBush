        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/08/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> So, once again, the place I am currently working has been interviewing for some more programmers and we’ve had to laugh at some of the answers we’ve received on some pretty simple question. For example, in answer to “How do you create an object in JavaScript?”  One applicant responded, “I always use the WHERE keyword.”  What?!!! And that naturally got us all talking about good interview questions.  How can we tell that the applicant is even worth interviewing? The following questions are not meant to be THE interview.  The questions are meant to shorten the interview process by ensuring the applicant has a basic understanding of the language they will be expected to work with. </p>
<h2 id="C-Interview-Questions"><a href="#C-Interview-Questions" class="headerlink" title="C# Interview Questions"></a>C# Interview Questions</h2><h3 id="1-What-is-the-difference-between-an-Object-and-a-Class"><a href="#1-What-is-the-difference-between-an-Object-and-a-Class" class="headerlink" title="1. What is the difference between an Object and a Class?"></a>1. What is the difference between an Object and a Class?</h3><p>This is an object oriented 101 question.  So if you can’t answer this, I might try a few other questions for show, but you’ve probably already been counted out.  The way I always described the difference between the two is that the Class is like a cookie cutter and an Object is like the cookie.  The class defines what the object is going to do, but the object is the thing actually doing the work. A more technical answer would be that the Class defines the object while the Object is the Class active in memory.</p>
<h3 id="2-What-is-“Polymorphism”"><a href="#2-What-is-“Polymorphism”" class="headerlink" title="2. What is “Polymorphism”?"></a>2. What is “Polymorphism”?</h3><p>This is my first stab at making sure you understand the basics of object oriented programming.  Does your answer at least include the concept of virtual functions?  Here is how I explain polymorphism. Polymorphism gets at the idea that you can have a method in a parent class and a method with the same name in a child class.  If the method in the parent class should be marked virtual and the method in the child class should be marked “overrides.”  At runtime, the decision as to which one is called is based on the type of the object that the method is called from.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/polymorphism.html">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/polymorphism.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some might want to include other concepts</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>But historically, polymorphism has been limited to the basic idea of virtual functions and the applicants response should, at the very least, reflect this answer.</p>
<h3 id="3-What-is-the-difference-between-overload-overrides-and-shadows"><a href="#3-What-is-the-difference-between-overload-overrides-and-shadows" class="headerlink" title="3. What is the difference between overload, overrides, and shadows?"></a>3. What is the difference between overload, overrides, and shadows?</h3><p>Again, this is to get at your understanding of object oriented programming generally and the sometimes confusing keywords in the language. - Overloading gets at the concept that you can have multiple methods with the same name hanging off a given class as long as the methods all have a different signature (parameter types), the code is legal. - Overrides is how polymorphism is implemented. - Shadows flips polymorphism on it’s head.  If you mark a method as shadowed using the “new” keyword, then instead of the method getting called based on the object type, the method gets called based on the variable type that is holding the reference to the object. So, give class A is a parent of class B and both have a method foo() and foo() is marked with the shadows keyword.  If you declare a variable of type A and point that variable to an object of type B, when you call foo off that object, A.foo() will be called.</p>
<h3 id="4-What-is-the-difference-between-the-keyword-“String”-and-the-keyword-“string”"><a href="#4-What-is-the-difference-between-the-keyword-“String”-and-the-keyword-“string”" class="headerlink" title="4. What is the difference between the keyword  “String” and the keyword “string”?"></a>4. What is the difference between the keyword  “String” and the keyword “string”?</h3><p>I work with some pretty sharp guys and even they stumbled on this one.  Do YOU know? When I was teaching C# for a training company, I would say, “The only difference is that ‘string’ turns blue in the editor.”  Of course now that you can configure the editor, that’s not really a good answer.  But you get the point.  Both keywords compile down to the same intermediate language.  Technically, “string” is an alias for “String”.  “String” is the proper class.</p>
<h3 id="5-What-is-“int”-an-alias-for"><a href="#5-What-is-“int”-an-alias-for" class="headerlink" title="5. What is “int” an alias for?"></a>5. What is “int” an alias for?</h3><p>Since we’ve already used the term alias by this point, I’m digging deep to find out just how much you know.  The proper answer is that “int” is an alias for the Int32 type.  I can forgive you if you say “class” but it really isn’t a class.  It is a type.</p>
<h3 id="6-What-is-the-difference-between-a-value-type-and-a-reference-type"><a href="#6-What-is-the-difference-between-a-value-type-and-a-reference-type" class="headerlink" title="6. What is the difference between a value type and a reference type?"></a>6. What is the difference between a value type and a reference type?</h3><p>Once again, I’m trying to find out how well you know what is going on.  Do you just hack at your code until it seems to work, or do you really understand what is happening under the hood? Again, when I was teaching this, the explanation always went something like this: The value of a value type occupies memory on the stack and when you do an assignment from one value type to another the data is copied from one memory location to the other.  Each variable is changed in isolation to the other. A reference type is a variable on the stack that points to memory in the heap that actually holds the value.  When you do an assignment from one reference type to another, only the pointer is copied.  In the end, both variables point to the same location on the heap. If you change the value of a reference type from one variable, the other variable is impacted with the change because it is the same location in memory you are changing. The key part of this answer is that the value of a value type occupies the memory the variable represents and that the value of a reference type is pointed to by the memory that the variable represents.  The stack vs heap issue is secondary and in fact gets clouded by the fact that once you put a value type in a reference type, either by boxing or by including it as a member of a class, the whole stack vs heap question gets quite murky.  But, using stack vs heap as a general way of discussing the main issue is a starting point at the very least.</p>
<h3 id="7-What-is-the-primary-factor-in-making-code-testable"><a href="#7-What-is-the-primary-factor-in-making-code-testable" class="headerlink" title="7. What is the primary factor in making code testable?"></a>7. What is the primary factor in making code testable?</h3><p>OK.  You knew I had to stick this one in here, right?  I doubt most programmers have given this much thought so it is OK if they have to spend some time thinking of the answer. What I’m hoping to hear is that dependencies make code untestable. Simplistic answer?  Maybe.  But the answer to this question, regardless of if it agrees with mine or not, will tell me if they’ve had any experience writing unit tests.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/08/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> I got a question this last week that I answered very briefly but I felt that to answer it completely would take a blog post.  So here’s the blog post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should the author of a piece of code be responsible for more than just unit testing, or does peer review have a play?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loaded question, right?  Obviously, the guy asking this question believes that an author should both unit test AND have peer review.  And I agree.  But to limit the role of a programmer to even those two things is a very narrow view of programming. Then I got to thinking about it and realized that most of what we’d be trying to accomplish with a code review encompasses everything we’d want to include in a list of things a developer is responsible for.  Further, a code review is mostly a review that ensures that 1) the code does what it is supposed to do, and 2) the code is easy to maintain in the future. In other words, all that the word “Peer review” or “Code review” encompasses is largely about code clarity. Code clarity addresses the issue we all have when we pick up a new piece of code.  Can you understand it easily?  I just listened to a <a href="//dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1172">DotNetRocks episode</a> that was all about the fact that we spend most of our time reading code and yet no one is talking about how we might do this better.  One way we can read code better is by writing it more clearly in the first place. Here are 15 ways you can make your code easier to read:</p>
<h2 id="Make-your-code-pretty"><a href="#Make-your-code-pretty" class="headerlink" title="Make your code pretty"></a>Make your code pretty</h2><p>I remember back when I was doing Clipper programming, we had one guy who would always show code that was ready to be printed in a text book.  I mean, regardless of what you had to say about what he had actually coded, the visual presentation of the code was a thing of beauty.  He had us believing that all of his code looked like that.  Then he went to work for some other company and we actually looked at the other code he had written.  It looked just like any other code. But it taught me a lesson.  A lesson I, unfortunately still need to be reminded of.  Pretty code is easier to maintain and implies a lot about the quality of the code.  Just like you wouldn’t go to an interview without wearing a suit because how you dress implies something about how you’ll program, your code should imply the quality by what it looks like before you ever start reading it.</p>
<h2 id="Establish-and-obey-naming-conventions-for-your-code"><a href="#Establish-and-obey-naming-conventions-for-your-code" class="headerlink" title="Establish and obey naming conventions for your code."></a>Establish and obey naming conventions for your code.</h2><p>I’ve written about this before.  Most notably when .NET first came out in the article about <a href="/hungarian-notation-use-what-works-spit-out-the-bones/">Hungarian Notation</a>.  As I point out in that article, not using Hungarian notation doesn’t mean you don’t have any standards.  Sure, you don’t want to prefix all of your integers with a lower case “I”, because you don’t care what kind of number it is.  But it is valuable to prefix a button with “button” so that it is easier to find in your Intellisense, or if you need to search your code for what you named it, it is much easier to find all of the buttons in your code this way. But there is another reason to establish and obey naming conventions.  Once you’ve done this, it makes it easier for everyone who is using those common conventions to read your code. For example, where I work, we have what I consider a very odd naming convention.  All of our POCO classes (we generate this ourselves because we are using DB2) are all UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE_SEPARATED.  And all our properties of POCO collections are named UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE_SEPARATEDs.  It used to drive me crazy, mostly because I use <a href="/resharper">ReSharper</a> religiously and the default rules aren’t setup to handle this odd convention.  But, it is a standard and, I can tell you now, you open a file that is using a POCO and you know you are dealing with a POCO.  No question about it! While I still don’t recommend the practice, I tell you that example because it illustrates how much a coding standard can instantly tell you something about the code you are working on before you ever start reading the code.</p>
<h2 id="Establish-and-obey-a-common-architecture"><a href="#Establish-and-obey-a-common-architecture" class="headerlink" title="Establish and obey a common architecture."></a>Establish and obey a common architecture.</h2><p>One of the biggest problems I have in reading other people’s code is if I can’t understand why they put things where they put them.  But having a common architecture that is easy to explain helps alleviate a lot of this problem.  One of the reasons I like working with frameworks is because much of the time these decisions are already made for you.  For example, just having a simple three tiered architecture that separates the View, Business Rules, and Data Access into different parts of your code can go a long way toward making code easy to read.  Within this basic framework you can layer in Model View Presenter, Model View Controller or any other design patterns.  Follow the mantra, “A place for everything and everything in its place” and your code will be much easier to follow.</p>
<h2 id="Name-objects-as-nouns-methods-as-verbs"><a href="#Name-objects-as-nouns-methods-as-verbs" class="headerlink" title="Name objects as nouns, methods as verbs."></a>Name objects as nouns, methods as verbs.</h2><p>This is so basic that I almost feel like I should have to write this here.  But I still see the principle violate all of the time.  So, here it is.  Obviously, if you aren’t following an object oriented methodology.  Say you are doing Functional or Procedural programming, you’ll need to adapt this rule to your environment.  But for OOP guys and gals.  Stop breaking this rule.  It is a sign of immaturity.</p>
<h2 id="Name-variable-what-they-are"><a href="#Name-variable-what-they-are" class="headerlink" title="Name variable what they are."></a>Name variable what they are.</h2><p>Similarly, stop with the short variable names unless you are using a language that is still so archaic as to require it.  I’ve written about this before.  Twice actually.  <a href="/tags/naming-conventions/">With rants about using i, j and k as variable names</a>.  The point here is that you want to be able to read your code and to do that your code has to tell you something about what you are doing.  Short variable names almost always never assist in code readability.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-include-a-noun-in-your-method"><a href="#Don’t-include-a-noun-in-your-method" class="headerlink" title="Don’t include a noun in your method."></a>Don’t include a noun in your method.</h2><p>This is different from just saying that method should be verbs.  There are a lot of places where I’ve seen code that has a verb AND a noun as a method name.  If you have a method that has both a noun and a verb in it, your class is probably trying to do too much. Wouldn’t it look funny if you had a Person class that had a method in it called FirstNameToLower()?</p>
<h2 id="Establish-a-cyclomatic-complexity-threshold-for-your-methods-and-obey-them-religiously"><a href="#Establish-a-cyclomatic-complexity-threshold-for-your-methods-and-obey-them-religiously" class="headerlink" title="Establish a cyclomatic complexity threshold for your methods and obey them religiously."></a>Establish a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> threshold for your methods and obey them religiously.</h2><p>Cyclomatic complexity takes into account how many statements have to be executed and, most importantly, how many conditionals have to be executed in your code.  The easiest way to reduce cyclomatic complexity is to reduce the number of conditions.  But aside from that, you can make your code much more readable by eliminating nesting where ever possible. One of my favorites is instead of writing code that looks something like this:</p>
<p>void SomeMethod()<br>{<br>   if(x != y)<br>   {<br>      // do stuff here<br>   }<br>}</p>
<p>You can make your code much more readable by writing it like this:</p>
<p>void SomeMethod()<br>{<br>   if(x == y) return;<br>   // do stuff here<br>}</p>
<p>Similarly, instead of nesting when this doesn’t work, as with while statements that contain other while statements, why not create a method for each while statement?</p>
<h2 id="Make-code-“self-documenting”"><a href="#Make-code-“self-documenting”" class="headerlink" title="Make code “self-documenting”"></a>Make code “self-documenting”</h2><p>That is, if you feel your code needs a comment, you probably have violated one or more of the other readability suggestions.  This is not to say that you should never add comments, but they should not be a replacement for readable code.  I generally leave comments for WHY I did something and leave the WHAT I did to the code.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-add-comments-for-things-that-you-can-deduce-by-reading-the-code"><a href="#Don’t-add-comments-for-things-that-you-can-deduce-by-reading-the-code" class="headerlink" title="Don’t add comments for things that you can deduce by reading the code."></a>Don’t add comments for things that you can deduce by reading the code.</h2><p>“This next line increments loopVar by 1” does no one any good and could eventually end up being litter in your code that makes the code harder to read.  Why?  Because it is possible for loopVar to get renamed, or removed and the comment could stick around forever.  Until we get compilers that verify our comments as well as our executable code, referencing variables in comments is a generally bad practice that should be avoided.</p>
<h2 id="Is-the-code-SOLID"><a href="#Is-the-code-SOLID" class="headerlink" title="Is the code SOLID?"></a>Is the code <a href="/pluralsightSOLID">SOLID</a>?</h2><ul>
<li>Single Responsibility of classes</li>
<li>Open/Close Principle</li>
<li>Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
<li>Interface Segregation Principle</li>
<li>Dependency Inversion</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Is-the-code-testable"><a href="#Is-the-code-testable" class="headerlink" title="Is the code testable?"></a>Is the code testable?</h2><p>If you follow all of the rules above, the code should be easy to test.  But, this is something that you should review your code for explicitly.</p>
<h2 id="Will-the-code-fail"><a href="#Will-the-code-fail" class="headerlink" title="Will the code fail?"></a>Will the code fail?</h2><p>Can anyone write code that uses any particular method that would make the method crash, throw an exception, or otherwise do something that was never intended?</p>
<h2 id="Code-duplications"><a href="#Code-duplications" class="headerlink" title="Code duplications."></a>Code duplications.</h2><p>I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty sure I’ve got code that looks practically the same littered throughout my code base.  One of my current goals is to make myself create a new method any time I’m getting ready to copy and paste more than three lines of code.</p>
<h2 id="100-Code-Coverage"><a href="#100-Code-Coverage" class="headerlink" title="100% Code Coverage"></a>100% Code Coverage</h2><p>Assuming you have unit test, do you have 100% code coverage on all of the methods that have a cyclomatic complexity score greater than 1?  I’m talking about code you’ve written.  I’ve written before about <a href="/100-code-coverage/">what code should be tested</a> and what code doesn’t need to be tested.</p>
<h2 id="Learn-the-vocabulary-of-your-language"><a href="#Learn-the-vocabulary-of-your-language" class="headerlink" title="Learn the vocabulary of your language"></a>Learn the vocabulary of your language</h2><p>John Sonmez wrote a very compelling article in 2013 about <a href="//simpleprogrammer.com/2013/04/14/what-makes-code-readable-not-what-you-think/">what makes code readable</a>.  In it he says that just like when we learn to read.  Code that is readable by a senior level developer may not be readable by an entry level developer simply because the entry level developer doesn’t have a firm grasp of the language.  Like John, I’ve been criticized for using the ternary operator because it is too terse.  Not descriptive enough.  Un-readable.  And I’ve always responded that arguing that the syntax isn’t clear is like arguing that a sentence isn’t clear because it uses a word you aren’t familiar with.  The word may actually be the perfect word for what the author is trying to communicate.  Your understanding of that word does not make the writing bad.  It just means the reader has some more learning to do. What else have you found makes your code more readable?  Leave me a comment below.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> For the last two years, about 99% of the work I’ve been doing has been JavaScript programming using EXTjs.  The problems I’ve encountered along the way are primarily related to testing.  Writing unit test using the “MVC Framework” out of the box is nearly impossible, but I did eventually put together an architecture that allows me to do that.  I may blog about that in the future. Today, what I want to offer is how I overcame various hurdles related to testing EXTjs with Selenium.  The first problem nearly everyone encounters when they first use EXTjs is that the views that are created are created dynamically.  If you use the recommended itemId to uniquely identify the elements on the page, you will be left with IDs that are dynamically generated and inconsistent.  That is, just because the ID has one value today doesn’t mean it will have the same value tomorrow.  And since the controls are dynamically created based on what browser is running, XPATH queries aren’t a good solution either.</p>
<h2 id="Custom-FindsBy-attribute"><a href="#Custom-FindsBy-attribute" class="headerlink" title="Custom FindsBy attribute"></a>Custom FindsBy attribute</h2><p>Now, you could solve this problem by creating a different Page Object for each browser and then you’d be able to use XPATH statements to go after the elements.  But, what if you could go after the itemIds directly?  By the Selenium APIs let you create your own selectors.  So, instead of writing your element properties like this:</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using=”someId”)]<br>private IWebElement SomeId{get; [UsedImplicitly]set;}</p>
<p>  You could do something like:</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Custom,<br>    CustomFinderType = typeof(ExtByComponentQuery),<br>    Using = “#someId”)]<br>private IWebElement SomeId{get; [UsedImplicitly]set;}</p>
<p>One of the side effects of using this extension is that you can now find any element using any valid EXTjs selector. So, you are probably wondering what the code looks like to get this all working.  Well here you go:</p>
<p>using System;<br>using System.Collections.Generic;<br>using System.Collections.ObjectModel;<br>using System.Linq;<br>using System.Threading;<br>using OpenQA.Selenium;<br>using OpenQA.Selenium.Internal;</p>
<p>namespace ENT.Supporting<br>{<br>    public class ExtByComponentQuery : By<br>    {<br>        private readonly string _locator;<br>        public ExtByComponentQuery(string locator)<br>        {<br>            _locator = locator;<br>        }</p>
<pre><code>public static ExtByComponentQuery Query(string locator)
{
    if (locator == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(&quot;locator&quot;, 
            @&quot;Cannot find elements when name locator is null.&quot;);
    return new ExtByComponentQuery(locator);
}

public override IWebElement FindElement(ISearchContext context)
{
    var elements = FindElements(context);
    if (elements != null &amp;&amp; elements.Count &gt; 0)
        return elements.First();
    Console.WriteLine(@&quot;returning null from FindElement&quot;);
    return null;
}

public override ReadOnlyCollection&lt;IWebElement&gt; FindElements(ISearchContext context)
{
    var script = string.Format(
</code></pre><p>@”var r= Ext.ComponentQuery.query(‘{0}’);<br>var rarray = [];<br>for(e = 0;e &lt; r.length;e++)<br>{ {<br>    if(r[e].getEl() !== undefined)<br>        rarray.push(r[e].getEl().dom);<br>}}<br>return rarray;”,_locator.Replace(“‘“,”\\’”));<br>            var javaScriptExecutor = context as IJavaScriptExecutor ??<br>                                     ((IWrapsDriver)context).WrappedDriver as IJavaScriptExecutor;<br>            if (javaScriptExecutor == null) return null;<br>            object scriptReturn = null;<br>            for (var i = 0; i &lt; 120 &amp;&amp; scriptReturn == null; i++)<br>            {<br>                if ( i &gt; 0) Thread.Sleep(1000);<br>                scriptReturn = javaScriptExecutor.ExecuteScript(script);<br>            }<br>            return scriptReturn == null ? null : new ReadOnlyCollection<iwebelement>((IList<iwebelement>)scriptReturn);<br>        }<br>    }<br>}</iwebelement></iwebelement></p>
<p>The constructor gets passed the selector string that is passed with the Using parameter in the attribute.  The FindElements() finds all of the elements that match the selector.  The FindElement() returns the first of all that it found. You can either use this code as part of the FindsBy attribute or you can use it stand alone by calling the static Query method. You’ll see that the bulk of the functionality is just the same JavaScript code you would normally write in EXTjs.</p>
<h2 id="Get-an-element’s-Value"><a href="#Get-an-element’s-Value" class="headerlink" title="Get an element’s Value"></a>Get an element’s Value</h2><p>One of the other problems you are likely to run into is retrieving the current value of an element.  This is because many of the controls that EXT provides to us do not use the INPUT item’s value to keep track of the value.  So, for this, and other similar scenarios, I wrote an extension method.</p>
<p>public static string GetExtValue(this IWebElement element)<br>{<br>    IWebElement realElement = null;<br>    if (element as IWrapsDriver == null)<br>    {<br>        var e = element as IWrapsElement;<br>        if (e != null) realElement = e.WrappedElement;<br>    }<br>    else<br>    {<br>         realElement = element;<br>    }</p>
<pre><code>if (realElement == null) return null;

var wrapsDriver = (IWrapsDriver)realElement;
var id = realElement.GetAttribute(&quot;id&quot;);
var driver = wrapsDriver.WrappedDriver;
var val = ((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(
    @&quot;return Ext.getCmp(arguments\[0\]).getRawValue();&quot;,
    id);
if (val == null)
{
    return string.Empty;
}
return val.ToString();
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>What you’ll want to pay attention to here is the code at the top. The if(element as IWrapsDriver) stuff is testing to see if we have the real element or if we have a proxy to the element that was created by the FindsBy attribute.  If the element is of type IWrapsDriver, we have the proxy and so need to go grab the real element before we continue.  Once we are sure we are working with a real element, we can use JavaScript to grab the raw value from EXTjs.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Modifications"><a href="#Other-Modifications" class="headerlink" title="Other Modifications"></a>Other Modifications</h2><p>I found that there were other modifications that I needed to make.  So I’ve also created extension methods that select items from dropdown list, Click radio buttons and checkboxes until they are actually selected (or actually unselected).  I found that they don’t always select or unselect on the first click for some reason.  Also, if your code is enabling and disabling stuff and you want to check for that, you’ll need to write some extensions to handle that because EXT uses a mask to disable.  The best way of determining if something is enabled or disabled is by writing JavaScript to ask EXT if it is enabled or disabled.  There are other things I’ve written that are somewhat project specific.  But if you run into a problem, your best bet is to create an extension method to go after EXT code directly.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I generally hate using the framework I’m using to test my code from EXTjs.  And whenever possible, I’ll look for a way to go after the elements using plain old selectors and the built in Selenium code.  But that isn’t always practical in this case.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> I had this thought this past week that we tend to believe that if we are in motion, we are accomplishing something.  That being busy somehow equals being productive.  And then I started thinking about how this is almost universal.  It doesn’t just impact how we program, which I’ll get to eventually, but it impacts all of our life.</p>
<h2 id="Let-Me-Illustrate"><a href="#Let-Me-Illustrate" class="headerlink" title="Let Me Illustrate"></a>Let Me Illustrate</h2><p>Have you ever driven to some location and had your favorite GPS system route you multiple ways?  How many of you take the route that is, according to your GPS, longer, just because the roads are 65mph instead of 45mph?  Or an even better example.  You hit a traffic jam and, even though ever indication is that you’ll be out of the traffic in a few minutes, you take an alternate route simply because the traffic is moving on that other road.  In both cases you probably know that you won’t get to your destination any faster, in fact you may get to your destination slower, but you still opt to take the moving route instead of the one that isn’t moving or is moving relatively slowly.  I’ve even heard people say… shoot I’ve even said… “I want to take this route because it moves faster.”  I like FEELING like I’m getting to my destination faster even if the reality is that I’m not. And then there is the issue of your job.  How many of you have to look busy for your peers to think that you ARE busy?  But as programmers, how true is that?  Unless you do some kind of unskilled labor, I doubt it is true of most people who work.  And yet, because we are all paid by the hour (yes, even those of you who are salaried are still trading hours for dollars) there is a perception that, somehow, if we are not in motion, we are not really working.  But is that true? I remember hearing a story about a programmer who spent half his day “staring at the ceiling” who was twice as productive as any of his peers.  Why is that?  Because he spent half his day thinking about the problem before he ever started writing a line of code. I remember back in the day when I was coding on 8088 computers, a compile and link cycle could take up to 10 minutes.  Because I recompile and test every time I’m made a runnable change, I had a lot of 10 minute breaks.  I used this time to think about the problem I was working on.  This was not intentional, it just happened naturally.  I think it made me more productive than if I were just churning code all day long at the speed our computers work today. And then there is this side project I’m working on.  I tend to work on it a half hour at a time as I have time.  Between my main gig that takes up 40 hours a week, and some side gigs that I have, I have a very small amount of time to work on this project.  Some days I don’t work on it simply because I’m too tired.  But sometimes, even when I’m not sitting in front of my computer, I’ll sit on my sofa doing nothing and think about the project.  It is in those times that I figure out where I want to take the project next, or how to solve a problem I’ve run into.  That time thinking, even though there is no motion, has made the resulting code that much better.</p>
<h2 id="The-Fallacy-of-Motion-and-Testing"><a href="#The-Fallacy-of-Motion-and-Testing" class="headerlink" title="The Fallacy of Motion and Testing"></a>The Fallacy of Motion and Testing</h2><p>I’m sure you saw this coming, but one has to ask, is it the fallacy of motion that prevents us from testing our code? At my main gig, I have to admit, I’m bored.  There are a lot of reasons for this.  But one of them is that I spend a lot of time waiting for integrations tests to run to verify that my code is still working.  To be clear, I have way more unit test than integration test at this point.  But with the changes I’m currently making to the system, I’m more likely to find issues via the integration tests than I am from the unit tests. Compare this to a project I’m working on for another client where I’m primarily writing new code.  I’m a lot less bored.  The day zips by.  I FEEL more productive. And yet, the degree of certainty I have that the code I wrote for my main gig works as I designed it to work is a lot higher than the code I’m currently writing because I have more tests. This past week those tests actually showed me that my change wasn’t working entirely the way I wanted it to.  I probably would not have found it any other way.  I’m not even sure the people testing my code would have found it.  They aren’t those kind of testers.  And so I’ve proven to myself one more time that testing, while it feels slower, really is not just the right thing to do, but ultimately the faster thing to do. Think about what would have happened if I didn’t have these tests in place.  I would have released the code, eventually the bug would have revealed itself, and I would be left scrambling to fix the bug.  As it is, I was able to fix the bug in a somewhat leisurely manner because I found it early. And yet, I don’t FEEL productive.  As much as I’m convinced that Test Driven Development is the right way to go, I still struggle with this Fallacy of Motion.</p>
<h2 id="We-Don’t-Have-Time-to-Test"><a href="#We-Don’t-Have-Time-to-Test" class="headerlink" title="We Don’t Have Time to Test"></a>We Don’t Have Time to Test</h2><p>I heard this again this past week.  “When you are working on a project with a tight deadline, you can’t always test because you don’t have enough time.” What?! Is this the Fallacy of Motion at work again? I would argue that it is precisely BECAUSE you are working under a tight deadline that you NEED to write test. Think about this, you have this tight deadline.  Great.  So you are not going to think clearly.  You are going to rush.  You will write incomplete code.  Your methods won’t verify input parameters.  You’ll have null pointer exceptions.  Your code will do what it is supposed to do, but will it not do what it shouldn’t do?  How will you know?  And who is going to catch the bug? Well we know the answer to that last question.  The people using your code will catch the bug.  This will make you look like an idiot.  You are because it is something that should have been caught.  It will also mean that you’ll need to track down the problem, fix the problem, and re-deploy the software.  And this is faster?  Faster than what?! Of course, “We don’t have time to do it right, but we always have time to do it over.”</p>
<h2 id="Slow-and-Steady"><a href="#Slow-and-Steady" class="headerlink" title="Slow and Steady"></a>Slow and Steady</h2><p>So, slow down.  Do things right.  Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare.  The race doesn’t always go to the fastest but the one who is steady and persistent.  The one who doesn’t cut corners.  The one who consistently produces solid code.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/ppl-kid-044.jpg" alt="ppl-kid-044" title="ppl-kid-044"> This probably doesn’t happen all that often, but this last week I came across the need to know which browser I was running my selenium test against.  I figured that buried deep in the object structure of Selenium, there MUST be a way of finding out what browser I was currently running.  As it turns out, I was right.  The situation that caused this requirement is that the place where I’m currently writing most of my code is upgrading all of the Firefox browsers.  I was asked to make sure the code we were running still works with the new browser.  When I did, I found that some of my tests broke even though the test itself still succeeds when it is run manually.  In fact, they only broke when running against this new version of Firefox. Now to be clear, this isn’t really a Firefox problem.  In fact, the new version of Firefox runs my test the way I would expect.  It is the current version of IE and the older version of Firefox that we were running in combination with EXTjs 4.2 that was a problem.  So, now I’m in a situation where I need to run my work around for everything except for this new version of Firefox. You see, we have several dropdown list.  To select an item from the list, I cursor down until the correct item is found.  My old implementation actually needed to cursor down twice.  The first time made the list display and kept the current item selected.  The second down arrow selected the next item.  The tab key keeps that item as the selected one.  The new version of Firefox only requires one down arrow and a tab to do the same thing. Since we have multiple dropdowns that behave the same way, I made this code an extension method, so I only have to do it once.  The other thing I’m doing that makes this work is that I’m proxying the elements using the FindsBy attribute.</p>
<p>[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using = “someIdHere”), CacheLookup]<br>private IWebElement SomePropertyName<br>    { get; [UsedImplicitly] set; }</p>
<p>  Under the hood this creates a proxy to the real element.  What we need access to is the Driver object that this element is using to get at the element on the browser.  I do that by going after the element’s WrappedDriver property.  In most code you’ll see this cast to an IWrapsDriver interface.  But it is actually pointing to a RemoteWebDriver object.  If we cast the type to that, we can then go after the Capabilities object which will give us access to the BrowserName. And so, my resulting code looks something like this:</p>
<p>var keyDown = Keys.Down + Keys.Down;<br>var wrapsDriver = ((IWrapsDriver)(element)).WrappedDriver;<br>if (wrapsDriver != null)<br>{<br>    if (wrapsDriver.GetType() == typeof(RemoteWebDriver) &amp;&amp;<br>        ((RemoteWebDriver)wrapsDriver)<br>        .Capabilities.BrowserName ==  “firefox”)<br>     {<br>        keyDown = Keys.Down;<br>     }<br>}</p>
<p>Which allows me to use the keyDown variable where ever I need to key down to select an item from the list. The element variable above represents the proxy element created by the FindsBy attribute.  The code is in the extension method that I mentioned previously, so it is actually the parameter that got passed into the extension method.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/07/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> Over the past ten years, I’ve successfully implemented various types of screen scraping in order to provide data to my clients.  Most of these implementations have involved accessing HTML and parsing out the data we needed for the web application. My latest implementation of this made use of the <a href="//htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/">HTML Agility Pack</a> and managed to incorporate the e-Labels For Education site into the Labels For Education site.  (No links, because the e-Labels program is being phased out.) Recently, I’ve been spending a lot of times on some site doing the same thing over and over again.  But most of the sites I visit now implement some kind of AJAX so that doing a simple web request to a page without also loading and parsing the JavaScript ends up giving me a page with no useful data at all.  Unlike the work I’ve done in the past where this was sufficient. This, combined with my recent work implementing Jasmine unit test for JavaScript and running them in the PhantomJS headless browser has had me thinking, wouldn’t it be great if I could do similar kinds of screen scraping, or even browser automation, but use something like an embedded version of PhantomJS to get the work done. Well, do a search for “embedded PhantomJS for .NET” or something similar and you’ll find that that isn’t possible.  At least not yet. But there is a viable alternative.  Actually there are a couple of viable alternative.  But they all end up using the Google Chromium browser API.  The implementation I ended up using is <a href="//github.com/cefsharp">CefSharp</a>.  Mostly because this is what is available from NuGet. What follows are some of the tricks I learned along the way.</p>
<h2 id="Installing-Chromium"><a href="#Installing-Chromium" class="headerlink" title="Installing Chromium"></a>Installing Chromium</h2><p>The first thing you’ll need to do once you have a project started, is that you’ll need to install the Chromium DLLs.  In the NuGet package manager, do a search for CefSharp.  This will bring up a list of plugins, you’ll want to install CefSharp.OffScreen and CefSharp.Common (I’m assuming you want to do off-screen automation here.)  The version I am working with is version 39. What I found difficult to figure out next was how to actually use the library.</p>
<h2 id="Get-It-Initialized"><a href="#Get-It-Initialized" class="headerlink" title="Get It Initialized"></a>Get It Initialized</h2><p>You’ll want to initialize the library before you use it.  The following lines will do that.  I just put this as early in my code as possible.</p>
<p>var settings = new CefSettings<br>    {LogSeverity = LogSeverity.Verbose};<br>settings.CefCommandLineArgs.Add(“no-proxy-server”, “1”);</p>
<p>Cef.OnContextInitialized = ()<br>    => Cef.SetCookiePath(“cookies”, true);</p>
<p>if (!Cef.Initialize(settings, shutdownOnProcessExit: false,<br>    performDependencyCheck: true))<br>{<br>     throw new Exception(“Unable to Initialize Cef”);<br>}</p>
<p>If you want to use a proxy server, you’ll need to look up the documentation for how to set the proxy server. The Cef.SetCookiePath sets the location of your cookie file.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-The-Browser-“Window”"><a href="#Creating-The-Browser-“Window”" class="headerlink" title="Creating The Browser “Window”"></a>Creating The Browser “Window”</h2><p>Now that you have this all set, you can use the ChromiumWebBrowser class to create a browser window.  Since the browser is disposable, you’ll want to either wrap the code in a using() statement or you’ll want to make sure you dispose of the browser object when you are done. You’ll want to set a few things on the browser object next.</p>
<p>browser.BrowserSettings<br>    .FileAccessFromFileUrlsAllowed = true;<br>browser.BrowserSettings<br>    .UniversalAccessFromFileUrlsAllowed = true;<br>browser.BrowserSettings<br>    .WebSecurityDisabled = true;</p>
<p>And then you’ll want to wait for the browser to initialize. Now the code I was given for this looks like this:</p>
<p>public static Task WaitForBrowserToInitialize(this ChromiumWebBrowser browser)<br>{<br>    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();</bool></p>
<pre><code>EventHandler handler = null;
handler = (sender, args) =&gt;
{
    browser.BrowserInitialized -= handler;
    tcs.TrySetResult(true);
};
browser.BrowserInitialized += handler;

return tcs.Task;
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>You’ll recognize this as an extension method.  What it is doing is waiting for the BrowserInitialized event to fire and then telling the task it can return.  This works great the first time you use it, but I found that when I created a new browser “window” the initialization happened so quickly that this was unreliable.  I’ve replaced this code with the more reliable version below.</p>
<p>public static Task WaitForBrowserToInitialize<br>    (this ChromiumWebBrowser browser)<br>{<br>    while (!Browser.IsBrowserInitialized)<br>    {<br>        await Task.Delay(100);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>It does the same thing.  It is just more reliable.</p>
<h2 id="Load-a-Page"><a href="#Load-a-Page" class="headerlink" title="Load a Page"></a>Load a Page</h2><p>Everything else is pretty straight forward.  To load a web page:</p>
<p>public static Task LoadUrl(this ChromiumWebBrowser browser,string url)<br>{<br>    browser.Load(url);<br>    return browser.WaitForPage();<br>}</p>
<p>That WaitForPage() method looks like this:</p>
<p>public static Task WaitForPage(this ChromiumWebBrowser browser)<br>{<br>    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();<br>    EventHandler<navstatechangedeventargs> handler = null;<br>    handler = (sender, args) =&gt;<br>    {<br>        //Wait for while page to finish loading not<br>        // just the first frame<br>        if (!args.IsLoading)<br>        {<br>            browser.NavStateChanged -= handler;<br>            tcs.TrySetResult(true);<br>        }<br>    };</navstatechangedeventargs></bool></p>
<pre><code>browser.NavStateChanged += handler;
return tcs.Task;
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<h2 id="Get-Data-Out"><a href="#Get-Data-Out" class="headerlink" title="Get Data Out"></a>Get Data Out</h2><p>If you need to get data out of the page, you can use GetSourceAsync();</p>
<p>var source = await browser.GetSourceAsync();</p>
<p>or you can use JavaScript to get at the DOM using</p>
<p>await EvaluateScriptAsync(javaScriptCodeHere);</p>
<p>  Note, you can also use EvaluateScriptAsync to do things like clicking buttons, scrolling the window and a lot of other useful things.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/06/spider.jpg" alt="spider" title="spider"> It amazes me how rare the skill of debugging software is.  It is even more amazing to me that after programming for over 27 years now, I still have trouble with this.  So, as a checklist for myself, and as a possible help to others along the way, I offer you “How to Debug Your Code” </p>
<h2 id="Is-It-Plugged-In-Is-It-Turned-On"><a href="#Is-It-Plugged-In-Is-It-Turned-On" class="headerlink" title="Is It Plugged In?  Is It Turned On?"></a>Is It Plugged In?  Is It Turned On?</h2><p>Another way of stating this is, “Validate your assumptions.”  I learned this phrase while I was traveling with a high school music group as a sound tech.  I was one of two guys who was responsible for making sure the sound equipment got from one site to the other and got setup at each site and was ready to go in time for the group to practice at least once before the performed. The thing with sound equipment is, there are lots of connections.  Lots of places to miss.  There were many times that we would set everything up and test it all out and there would be no sound, or partial sound.  I’m ashamed to tell you how many hours we wasted tracking the problem down only to find that something wasn’t connected.  An amp wasn’t turned on.  A plug had come out of the wall.  Cables had become disconnected. And the same sort of thing happens with our code.  You deploy code to the wrong directory and wonder why it isn’t showing up in the browser.  You deploy code to the right directory, but you forgot to get it from version control before you did.</p>
<h2 id="Read-the-Error-Message"><a href="#Read-the-Error-Message" class="headerlink" title="Read the Error Message"></a>Read the Error Message</h2><p>This is especially true with .NET but even when all you have is an error code, the error message is useful. In .NET, when you get an error message, it all but tells you what line of code you need to fix.  And even if you don’t understand the error.  You can copy and paste the error into a search engine and you are likely to come up with multiple possible solutions.  Even if all you have is an error code.</p>
<h2 id="Sometimes-the-Error-Message-Is-Hidden"><a href="#Sometimes-the-Error-Message-Is-Hidden" class="headerlink" title="Sometimes the Error Message Is Hidden"></a>Sometimes the Error Message Is Hidden</h2><p>I was just working on some code last night after putting in a very long day.  My code wasn’t working so I finally decided to pull up the debugger.  In this case, the code was JavaScript and I’m running it in Chrome because what I’m writing is a Chrome plugin.  When I finally loaded the plugin with the debugger active, it was then that I saw the console log message telling me that my variable wasn’t defined.  Talk about stupid mistakes.  My variable was code I meant to enter as a string, but because I didn’t put quotes around it, the JavaScript engine saw it as an undefined variable.</p>
<h2 id="Run-the-Debugger"><a href="#Run-the-Debugger" class="headerlink" title="Run the Debugger"></a>Run the Debugger</h2><p>Once I’ve eliminated the obvious, the next thing is to pull out the debugger and set break points.  Now, this can be tedious.  How many times have you decided to step over when you should have stepped in?  Arrrgh.  Now I have to start over again. Well, here’s how I speed things up. At the top level function.  I initially step over until I find out what line is causing the problem.  If you have an exception that is being thrown, this is easy to do because you just have to wait for the exception.  If you are getting a wrong answer, it may be a bit more difficult because you’ll have to verify your expected results along the way.  But the point is, you need to find out what line is throwing things off or you will be there all day, stepping through code one line at a time. Once you know which line in that function is causing trouble, you step into that line on the next run and step over each line in the lower level function until you find out what line is causing a problem there. Rinse, lather, repeat, until you find the problem.</p>
<h2 id="Step-In-To-Libraries"><a href="#Step-In-To-Libraries" class="headerlink" title="Step In To Libraries"></a>Step In To Libraries</h2><p>This goes back to validating your assumptions, but I call it out here separately because we never think that we’ve made an assumption about something that is supposed to be a “black box” when in fact, we have. Back in the day when I was doing a lot of Visual C++ coding, I learned a lot about how MFC worked by stepping into the MFC code.  So much so that I became the expert in my office regarding fixing C++/MFC related bugs. Today I’m doing a lot of JavaScript coding.  For the last two years I’ve actually done more JavaScript than C#.  Specifically, I’m writing a lot of EXTjs code.  The thing about EXTjs is that the framework is pretty complex.  I would argue too complex.  But that’s another post.  What I want to point out here is that I’ve fixed a lot of issues with my EXTjs code by stepping into the EXTjs framework code, as painful as that was, to find out why my code was behaving the way it was.</p>
<h2 id="The-Search-Engines-Are-Your-Friends"><a href="#The-Search-Engines-Are-Your-Friends" class="headerlink" title="The Search Engines Are Your Friends"></a>The Search Engines Are Your Friends</h2><p>This one should be obvious.  But, unfortunately it isn’t. The hardest part about searching is trying to figure out what other people may have used to describe the problem so that you can find the answer that is just sitting out there waiting for you.  I’m convinced that as intelligent as the search engines have become, using them is still a kind of art.</p>
<h2 id="Explain-the-Problem-to-a-Co-Worker"><a href="#Explain-the-Problem-to-a-Co-Worker" class="headerlink" title="Explain the Problem to a Co-Worker"></a>Explain the Problem to a Co-Worker</h2><p>You would be amazed at how often the act of describing a problem to someone else brings the obvious solution to light.  If you’ve ever done this, you know that often, in the middle of describing the problem, you’ll says, “… oh, never mind.  I know what the problem is now.” Which leads to my alternative solutions…</p>
<h2 id="Explain-the-Problem-to-Your-Coffee-Cup"><a href="#Explain-the-Problem-to-Your-Coffee-Cup" class="headerlink" title="Explain the Problem to Your Coffee Cup"></a>Explain the Problem to Your Coffee Cup</h2><p>Why?   Because it isn’t your co-worker who helped you solve the problem when you explained it to him.  It was the act of explaining it.  Once you’ve articulated the problem well enough to explain it to someone else, that act actually often hands you the solution.</p>
<h2 id="Step-Away-For-a-While"><a href="#Step-Away-For-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Step Away For a While"></a>Step Away For a While</h2><p>I don’t know why it is, but for some reason, we seem to think that if we aren’t coding, we aren’t working.  But you can’t work non-stop as a programmer for 4 – 8 hours without taking a break.  And banging your head against a bug when you’ve already done that for 15 minutes probably isn’t going to produce any better results if you do it for another 4 hours. Yeah, you may try a bunch of stuff.  You may look busy.  But the fact of the matter is, you might be better off finding something else to do for an hour or so and then coming back to the problem once you’re brain has had a rest from it. Well, those are my tips for now.  What tips do you have?  Leave them in the comments.  </p>

<p>If you’ve been programming in any other environment than JavaScript for a while, you may be making assumptions about JavaScript Scope that just aren’t true.  One of those assumptions is how variables get evaluated when you run the JavaScript code and what variables are visible and at what point in the code they are visible.</p>
<p>Just as a test to see how well you know your JavaScript, let’s create a few tests scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="Quiz"><a href="#Quiz" class="headerlink" title="Quiz"></a>Quiz</h2><h3 id="1-Given-the-following-code"><a href="#1-Given-the-following-code" class="headerlink" title="1) Given the following code:"></a>1) Given the following code:</h3><p>var foo;<br>foo = “xyz”;</p>
<p>function bar()<br>{<br>    foo = “abc”;<br>    var foo;<br>}<br>bar();<br>console.log(foo);</p>
<p>What is displayed in the console window when console.log(foo) is executed?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<h3 id="2-Given-the-following-code"><a href="#2-Given-the-following-code" class="headerlink" title="2) Given the following code:"></a>2) Given the following code:</h3><p>var i = 20;</p>
<p>for(var i = 0;i &lt; 10;i++){<br>    console.log(i);<br>}</p>
<p>console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i);</p>
<p>What is the value of i when console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i) is executed?</p>
<p>Why?</p>

<p>var foo = function(){<br>    console.log(‘foo was called’);<br>}</p>
<h3 id="4-Why-would-changing-the-previous-code-to-this-next-block-of-code-fix-the-issue-with-the-previous-code"><a href="#4-Why-would-changing-the-previous-code-to-this-next-block-of-code-fix-the-issue-with-the-previous-code" class="headerlink" title="4) Why would changing the previous code to this next block of code fix the issue with the previous code?"></a>4) Why would changing the previous code to this next block of code fix the issue with the previous code?</h3><p>foo();</p>
<p>function foo(){<br>    console.log(‘foo was called’);<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Answers"><a href="#Answers" class="headerlink" title="Answers"></a>Answers</h2><p>1) The value of foo when console.log(foo) is executed is “xyz”</p>
<p>2) The value of i when console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i) is executed is 10</p>
<p>3) foo is declared but undefined when we try to call it on the first line</p>
<p>4) because foo is both declared and defined when it is called on the first line</p>
<h2 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h2><p>How did you do?</p>
<h2 id="1-“Hoisting”"><a href="#1-“Hoisting”" class="headerlink" title="1) “Hoisting”"></a>1) “Hoisting”</h2><p>The first thing you need to understand about how JavaScript processes code is that it goes through the block of code you are working with and processes the variable declarations first.  That is anything in the global scope (window for browsers, global for server) or anything within a function block.  From the JavaScript compiler’s perspective, the code in example 1 looks like this:</p>
<p>var foo;<br>foo = “xyz”;</p>
<p>function bar()<br>{<br>    var foo;<br>    foo = “abc”;<br>}<br>bar();<br>console.log(foo);</p>
<p>So that the foo = “abc” line assigns the string “abc” to the variable foo in the bar function’s local scope.  Not impacting the variable foo in global scope so that the result at the end of the code sample is that the foo variable still has the value “xyz”.</p>
<h2 id="2-Only-functions-and-catch-blocks-create-“block-scope”"><a href="#2-Only-functions-and-catch-blocks-create-“block-scope”" class="headerlink" title="2) Only functions and catch blocks create “block scope”"></a>2) Only functions and catch blocks create “block scope”</h2><p>In most languages that I use, if I wanted to create a variable that only had effect within a for, if, or while block, I could create a variable within the braces, or inline like in this example, and the code in the outer block would be left untouched.  But in JavaScript, this would only work if you were using the LET keyword which only appears in ECMA6 and above.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, it is perfectly legal to declare a variable multiple time.  The compiler will not complain.  So, when we run the code in example 2, the declaration within the for() is ignored and it just reuses the declaration at the beginning of the code snippet.</p>
<p>If you really wanted to declare a function within its own scope, you could create the scope with a try/catch block, like this:</p>
<p>try {throw i;}<br>catch(i){<br>    for(var i = 0;i&lt; 10;i++) {<br>        console.log(i);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>console.log(‘final i: ‘ + i);</p>
<p>Which would give you the behavior you were probably expecting.  The code above will print out ‘final i: 20’ like you were probably expecting above.</p>
<h2 id="3-“Hoisting”-and-function-assignments"><a href="#3-“Hoisting”-and-function-assignments" class="headerlink" title="3) “Hoisting” and function assignments"></a>3) “Hoisting” and function assignments</h2><p>Going back to our discussion about variable declarations being processed first, and then doing any assignments, it becomes obvious that we can’t call a function that we haven’t assigned to the variable yet.  I don’t think I need to discuss this any further than I already have.  This works like any other variable declaration as I’ve discussed above.</p>
<h2 id="4-“Hoisting”-and-function-declarations"><a href="#4-“Hoisting”-and-function-declarations" class="headerlink" title="4) “Hoisting” and function declarations"></a>4) “Hoisting” and function declarations</h2><p>Function declarations, on the other hand, behave differently than function assignments.  In the case of function declarations, the variable AND the function that is “assigned” to it get pulled to the top of our code.  So using function declarations over function assignments is preferred simply because it assures us that the function pointer is available whenever we need it.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, maybe you thought you knew JavaScript.  Maybe you did.  Maybe you discovered you didn’t know it as well as you thought. I would encourage you to really learn the language.  One of the best resources I’ve found for learning programming stuff is <a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight</a>.  Check them out.

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/CHIL0007.png" alt="CHIL0007" title="CHIL0007">There is a guy I’m working with who is trying to wrap his head around design principles.  He’s been watching a lot of <a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight videos</a>.  As he was processing information about <a href="/pluralsightIoC">Inversion of Control</a>, he asked the natural question I’ve never actually considered before.  “Why is it called Inversion of Control?  Normally, when you talk about ‘Inversion’ you are talking about reversing something or negating something.  That isn’t what we are doing here.” </p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Inversion-of-Control"><a href="#What-Is-Inversion-of-Control" class="headerlink" title="What Is Inversion of Control?"></a>What Is Inversion of Control?</h2><p>So, let’s start with a definition of what Inversion of Control is.  And let’s start the definition by explaining what it isn’t. In the old days, back when I started programming.  We had this thing called “Procedural Programming.” Control of your application flowed from beginning to end with looping to take care of any kind of waiting that needed to take place.  <a href="//martinfowler.com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html">Martin Fowler describes this</a> using an illustration that is version similar to a basic “How to program in C#” console application that is in the beginning of most beginner programming books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s consider a simple example. Imagine I’m writing a program to get some information from a user and I’m using a command line enquiry. I might do it something like this</p>
<p>  #ruby<br>  puts ‘What is your name?’<br>  name = gets<br>  process_name(name)<br>  puts ‘What is your quest?’<br>  quest = gets<br>  process_quest(quest)</p>
<p>In this interaction, my code is in control: it decides when to ask questions, when to read responses, and when to process those results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Inversion of Control does is that it puts something other than the main code in charge of doing critical parts of the program so that those other parts of the program can be swapped out by the person implementing the code.</p>
<h2 id="Examples-of-Inversion-of-Control"><a href="#Examples-of-Inversion-of-Control" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Inversion of Control"></a>Examples of Inversion of Control</h2><p>If you’ve ever written a WebForms or Windows Forms application, you’ve already experience inversion of control.</p>
<h3 id="OnPageLoad-or-OnFormLoad"><a href="#OnPageLoad-or-OnFormLoad" class="headerlink" title="OnPageLoad() or OnFormLoad()"></a>OnPageLoad() or OnFormLoad()</h3><p>You have probably never even given this much thought.  You think these two methods are where your code starts.  But the reality is, the code started long before these methods ever got called.  The thing that is in control is the .NET framework.  You’ve created a delegate that gets called by the framework so that your page or form does what you want it to.  Without this inversion of control, you would have to write a whole lot more code.</p>
<h3 id="Event-Handlers"><a href="#Event-Handlers" class="headerlink" title="Event Handlers"></a>Event Handlers</h3><p>While you might think of OnPageLoad and OnFormLoad as event handlers, the way they are implemented are more like virtual functions.  Event handlers, on the other hand, are a specific type of delegate that say, “When this thing happens, let me know about it.”  The code that fires the event doesn’t even really care what you do during the event.  Again, the control has been “Inverted” because there is a lot of code that is running that you have no control over and probably have no knowledge of.</p>
<h3 id="Virtual-Functions"><a href="#Virtual-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Functions"></a>Virtual Functions</h3><p>One of my favorite methods of inverting control is to use virtual functions.  I can have a parent class that controls the flow of the program that calls various virtual functions in order.  But my child class can provide the implementation of the functions to make them do various things.  I used this, at one time in the past, to create a framework for submitting links to various bookmarking sites.  They all worked essentially the same way, all I had to do was implement the specific details for each site while 80% of my code stayed the same in the base class.</p>
<h3 id="Delegates-or-Callback-Functions"><a href="#Delegates-or-Callback-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Delegates or Callback Functions"></a>Delegates or Callback Functions</h3><p>Another common way of implementing inversion is by using delegates or callbacks.  This work in a similar way to virtual functions expect that the functions are typically passed in to a method.  Much of the current implementation of JavaScript uses this method of inverting control as a primary pattern (but not limited to it as the only way.)</p>
<h3 id="Dependency-Injection"><a href="#Dependency-Injection" class="headerlink" title="Dependency Injection"></a>Dependency Injection</h3><p>I’ve <a href="/dependency-injection-not-di/">talked about Dependency Injection before</a>.  Again, it is another way of delegating control to something other than the code that has main control.  What I want to make special note of here, though, is that Inversion of Control is not Dependency Injection but Dependency Injection is a form of Inversion of Control.  I think this is where most of the confusion about Inversion of Control comes from.  Most of the literature that talks about Inversion of Control talks about it at the same time they are talking about Dependency Injection.  As though the two concepts were the same.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Inversion-of-Control-Matters"><a href="#Why-Inversion-of-Control-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Inversion of Control Matters"></a>Why Inversion of Control Matters</h2><p>Finally, I want to talk for a bit about why Inversion of Control matters.  Because, for me, it is a lot more important that we understand what we are trying to achieve than it is that we’ve given it the right name or that we even know what name to call it.  All of the examples I’ve provided are things you’ve probably done in your code.  Some of them you’ve done without even knowing you were doing them.  But think about the alternative of not doing them. First, your code would be a lot harder to maintain.  Just think of how hard it would be to write a web site and maintain it if you had to write code that handled all of the work that happens for you behind the scenes. Second, it makes the code more loosely coupled.  And by doing that, it makes the code testable AND it makes the code more flexible and easy to change in the future. Maybe instead of calling it Inversion of Control it should have been called Delegation of Control.  Either way, the concept is to remove as much code as possible from our main controlling code and give the implementation responsibility to something else that can be swapped in without having to change the main loop.</p>

        <p><img src="/uploads/2015/05/18Tr.png" alt="SpecFlow Tutorial Session" title="18Tr">A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a post describing <a href="/setting-up-specflow/">how to setup SpecFlow</a> in which I promised to continue with how to actually use it once you have it installed.  What follows is a SpecFlow Tutorial of the tips and tricks I wish I’d known when I was starting out. </p>
<h2 id="Controlling-Associations-between-Features-and-Steps"><a href="#Controlling-Associations-between-Features-and-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Controlling Associations between Features and Steps"></a>Controlling Associations between Features and Steps</h2><p>With what you’ve learned so far, you might be able to successfully put together a set of tests for a particular page that you want to test. But as soon as you start working on the second page, you will probably discover that you have steps that seem to conflict with each other. It is at this point you will find that the ability to associate features with step files becomes critical. Fortunately, this is relatively easy. In your feature file, you will specify a category using the @category syntax and within your step file, you will use the category attribute within the step file at the class level to tie the two together. In your feature file:</p>
<p>@stepFileOne<br>Feature: SpecFlowFeature1<br>    In order to avoid silly mistakes<br>    As a math idiot<br>    I want to be told the sum of two numbers</p>
<p>And in your step file:</p>
<p>namespace SpecFlowDemos<br>{<br>    [Binding]<br>    [Category(“stepFileOne”)]<br>    public sealed class StepFileOne<br>    { …<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>Note, if you put steps in a step file that doesn’t have a category associated with it or you create a feature file that doesn’t have a category assigned to it, you’ll see all of the steps that are available. So you will want to have categories applied to everything. If you need to, you can apply categories to specific scenarios in your feature file and specific steps in your step file to gain even more control.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Repeat-Yourself-DRY"><a href="#Don’t-Repeat-Yourself-DRY" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)"></a>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</h2><h3 id="Background-section"><a href="#Background-section" class="headerlink" title="Background section"></a>Background section</h3><p>It is common to have a set of steps that repeat for each scenario. Much like a setup section in NUnit or MSTest. One of the ways you can handle this is by creating a background section.</p>
<p>Background:<br>    Given I have entered 50 into the calculator<br>    And I have entered 70 into the calculator</p>
<p>Scenario: Add two numbers<br>    When I press add<br>    Then the result should be 120 on the screen</p>
<p>The background section runs for each scenario in the feature file.</p>
<h3 id="Running-Steps-from-another-Step"><a href="#Running-Steps-from-another-Step" class="headerlink" title="Running Steps from another Step"></a>Running Steps from another Step</h3><p>You could also create a step that combines all of the common steps together and then have that step run all of the steps.</p>
<p>Scenario: Add two numbers<br>    Given the calculator has been setup<br>    When I press add<br>    Then the result should be 120 on the screen</p>
<p>  Then in your Step file, you’ll need to change your Step class to inherit from Step</p>
<p>public sealed class StepFileOne : Steps<br>{<br> …<br>}</p>
<p>And then create your step to call the other steps like this:</p>
<p>[Given(@”the calculator has been setup”)]<br>public void GivenTheCalculatorHasBeenSetup()<br>{<br>    Given(“I have entered 50 into the calculator”);<br>    Given(“I have entered 70 into the calculator”);<br>}</p>
<p>Yes, you could call the methods directly, but only if the methods are in the same class.  If you have step methods that span multiple classes, you’ll want to use this method so that you can maintain the context of the test you are running.</p>
<h3 id="Before-After-Attributes"><a href="#Before-After-Attributes" class="headerlink" title="Before/After Attributes"></a>Before/After Attributes</h3><p>Finally, you may have setup steps that really have nothing to do with the actual test. In the case of testing web pages or other applications, you’ll probably have to load the page or start up the application and wait for the page to be ready to use prior to doing anything else. And once you have completed your test, you’ll want to do some clean up. At the very least, you’ll want to close the web page. For this, SpecFlow provides the Before attribute and the After attribute. Just like the step definitions, the methods attributed with Before and After will run based on the categories they are associated with.</p>
<p>[Before]<br>public void BeforeScenario(“categoryToAssociateWith”)<br>{<br>    //TODO: implement logic that has to<br>    // run before executing each scenario<br>}</p>
<p>[After]<br>public void AfterScenario(“categoryToAssociateWith”)<br>{<br>    //TODO: implement logic that has to<br>    //run after executing each scenario<br>}</p>
<p>Other before/after attributes that you can use (from <a href="//www.specflow.org/documentation/Hooks/">//www.specflow.org/documentation/Hooks/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Attribute</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tag filtering</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>[BeforeTestRun] [AfterTestRun]</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after the entire test run_Note: As the most of the unit test runners do not provide a hook for executing logic after the test execution has been finished, the [AfterTestRun] event is triggered by the test assembly unload event. The exact timing and thread of this execution might be different for each test runner._The method it is applied to must be static.</p>
<p>[BeforeFeature] [AfterFeature]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each featureThe method it is applied to must be static.</p>
<p>[BeforeScenario] or [Before] [AfterScenario] or [After]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario or scenario outline exampleThe short attribute names are available from v1.8.</p>
<p>[BeforeScenarioBlock] [AfterScenarioBlock]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario block (e.g. between the “givens” and the “whens”)</p>
<p>[BeforeStep] [AfterStep]</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>automation logic that has to run before/after executing each scenario step</p>
<p>You can annotate a single method with multiple attributes.</p>
<h2 id="Sharing-Data-Between-Step-and-Binding-Files"><a href="#Sharing-Data-Between-Step-and-Binding-Files" class="headerlink" title="Sharing Data Between Step and Binding Files"></a>Sharing Data Between Step and Binding Files</h2><p>Once you’ve setup your tests with the <code>Before</code> and <code>After</code> methods, you will probably need to save the information in a location where you can get to it while you are running the tests. You might be tempted to place this information in a member variable or a property but, if you’ve done as I’ve suggested, and placed your <code>Before</code> and <code>After</code> methods in separate files from your steps, you’ll see that this won’t make a lot of sense. Instead, what I recommend that you do is that you save the information into the <code>ScenarioContext</code> object using this syntax.</p>
<p>ScenarioContext.Current[“page”] = someValue;</p>
<p>Then, later on in your testing process, you can retrieve the value using:</p>
<p>var x = (RealObjectType)ScenarioContext.Current[“page”])</p>
<p>where “RealObjectType” is a class name that represents the type of the object that you originally stored. I typically use the Before and After scenarios to open and close the page I want to test while using Selenium. Without going into a whole lot of detail about how this works, my Before and After routine looks something like this:</p>
<p>private ISpmInitial Page<br>{<br>    get { return (ISpmInitial)(ScenarioContext.Current[“page”]); }<br>    set { ScenarioContext.Current[“page”] = value; }<br>}</p>
<p>[Before]<br>public void Before()<br>{<br>    const string id = “10039219”;<br>    var pages = new ConcurrentStack<ispminitial>();<br>    Parallel.Invoke(<br>        () => pages.Push(SpmPageFactory.GetPageModel(“FireFoxGrid”, id))<br>        ,<br>        () => pages.Push(SpmPageFactory.GetPageModel(“IE11Grid”, id))<br>    );<br>    var pagesArray = pages.ToArray();<br>    Page = new ParallelPage<ispminitial>(pagesArray).Cast();<br>}</ispminitial></ispminitial></p>
<p>[After]<br>public void After()<br>{<br>    if (Page == null) return;<br>    Page.Dispose();<br>    Page = null;<br>}</p>
<p>This code is using the Selenium parallelization code I’ve already talked about in my article, <a href="/running-selenium-in-parallel-with-any-net-unit-testing-tool/">Running Selenium In Parallel With Any .NET Unit Testing Tool</a>. The <code>Before</code> method creates my page object for the browsers I’m using. Once I have the page object, I store it into my private <code>Page</code> property which uses the <code>ScenarioContext</code> as the backing store. Then, in the step files that need access to this same page object, I create a similar <code>Page</code> property so that they can access the page object from the steps.</p>
<h2 id="Parameterized-Tests"><a href="#Parameterized-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Parameterized Tests"></a>Parameterized Tests</h2><p>It is quite common to have tests for multiple scenarios that essentially look the same except for the parameters change. Instead of using copy/paste/modify, you can create parameterized test by using the Scenario Outline directive.</p>
<p>Scenario Outline: Uses parameters<br>    Given I have entered <n1> into the calculator<br>    And I have entered <n2> into the calculator<br>    When I press <operation><br>    Then the result should be <result> on the screen</result></operation></n2></n1></p>
<pre><code>Examples: 
| n1 | n2 | operation | result |
| 1  | 2  | add       | 3      |
| 5  | 3  | subtract  | 2      |
| 5  | -3 | add       | 2      |
</code></pre><p>Keep in mind that the step that gets run is based on the merged result. So you could have multiple steps that implement any particular line in your scenario outline.</p>
<h2 id="Alternate-ways-of-structuring-your-test"><a href="#Alternate-ways-of-structuring-your-test" class="headerlink" title="Alternate ways of structuring your test"></a>Alternate ways of structuring your test</h2><h3 id="Data-Tables"><a href="#Data-Tables" class="headerlink" title="Data Tables"></a>Data Tables</h3><p>Scenario: Data Table Example<br>    Given I’ve Entered The Following Information<br>    | Field     | Value                   |<br>    | FirstName | “Dave”                  |<br>    | LastName  | “Bush”                  |<br>    | email     | “<a href="mailto:davembush@dmbcllc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">davembush@dmbcllc.com</a>“ |</p>
<p>  The first column is the names of the fields. The second column is the values. To pull the information out in the step, create, or use an existing class that has the same field names and write code similar to the following in your step.</p>
<p>class Person<br>{<br>    string FirstName { get; set; }<br>    string LastName { get; set; }<br>    string email { get; set; }<br>}</p>
<p>[Given(@”I’ve Entered The Following Information”)]<br>public void GivenIVeEnteredTheFollowingInformation(Table table)<br>{<br>    var person = table.CreateInstance<person>();<br>    // Do something with person here<br>}</person></p>
<p>You can use a horizontal layout like this:</p>
<p>Scenario: Data Table Example<br>    Given I’ve Entered The Following Information<br>    | FirstName | LastName | email                   |<br>    | “Dave”    | “Bush”   | “<a href="mailto:davembush@dmbcllc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">davembush@dmbcllc.com</a>“ |<br>    | “John”    | “Doe”    | “<a href="mailto:jdoe@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jdoe@gmail.com</a>“        |</p>
<p>In this case you use the <code>CreateSet</code> call to create a list of Person objects.</p>
<p>[Given(@”I’ve Entered The Following Information”)]<br>public void GivenIVeEnteredTheFollowingInformation<br>    (Table table)<br>{<br>    var people = table.CreateSet<person>();<br>    // Do something with people here<br>}</person></p>
<p>Finally, you may have the need to enter parameter data that is longer than will reasonably fit on one line or that needs to be on multiple lines. To do that, you delimit the beginning and end of the multi-line section with three double quotes.</p>
<p>[Given(@”I have lots of text”)]<br>public void GivenIHaveLotsOfText(string multilineText)<br>{<br>    ScenarioContext.Current.Pending();<br>}</p>
<p>The multi-line text will be passed as the last parameter in your step method. There are probably some features I missed here.  But this is already more than what I use on a day to day basis in my own SpecFlow testing scenarios.</p>
