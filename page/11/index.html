        <p>As I’ve written before, <a href="/tags/angular-js/">I’m using AngularJS a lot</a> recently to write the client side of my web applications.  As I’ve gotten to the end of my current project, I found myself needing to implement cache busting and while I am at it compression.  But because I’m <a href="/asp-net-angular-js-html5mode/">using a regular HTML page to serve up the shell for my single page application</a>, using the regular ASP.NET on the fly compression wasn’t going to work for this application.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of tools in the Node.js space that will work.  Would it be possible to wire node.js and Gulp with ASP.NET in my existing web project? It turns out you can.</p>
<p>Although, at this point, it isn’t as straightforward as most other things in Visual Studio.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2016/01/image-2.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Installing-Node-js"><a href="#Installing-Node-js" class="headerlink" title="Installing Node.js"></a>Installing Node.js</h2><p>I’m assuming that you’ve already installed Visual Studio 2015.  If you did that, you already have Node.js installed.  The problem is, it isn’t the most recent version.  So, what you want to do is to install the most recent of version from the <a href="//nodejs.org">Node.js site</a> manually.</p>
<p>Once you have Node.js installed, the next thing you will need to do is that you’ll need to configure Visual Studio to use the version you installed instead of the version it installed.  To do this, navigate to “Tools” &gt; “Options”.  In the resulting dialog, find the “Projects and Solutions” &gt; “External Web Tools” leaf in the tree control and then add the directory to your newly installed Node.js installation to the top of the list of paths to external tools. <a href="/uploads/2016/01/image-3.png"><img src="/uploads/2016/01/image_thumb.png" alt="image" title="image"></a></p>
<h2 id="NPM"><a href="#NPM" class="headerlink" title="NPM"></a>NPM</h2><p>To use Gulp, you will need to install Gulp using the Node Package Manager (npm).  There are several places where I got stuck.</p>
<p>First, I tried to install gulp using the Node Interactive Window (CTRL-K,N).  This works fine when you want to install something globally, but when you want to install something with the –save or –save-dev option, you will get the error message: <code>Please specify a valid Node.js project or project directory.</code> It took me several tries before it finally dawned on me that it wasn’t just asking “What project do you want to install this in?”  It was asking “What Node project do you want to install this in?” We don’t have a node project, so this will never work.  What you will need to do instead is that you’ll need to shell out to the command prompt, change to the project directory, and then type your npm commands.</p>
<h2 id="Productivity-Power-Tools"><a href="#Productivity-Power-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Productivity Power Tools"></a>Productivity Power Tools</h2><p>You can shell out to the command prompt much easier if you install the <a href="//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/34ebc6a2-2777-421d-8914-e29c1dfa7f5d?SRC=VSIDE">Visual Studio Productivity Power Tools</a>  Once these are installed, you can right click on the project you want to install npm packages into and select “Power Commands” &gt; “Open Command Prompt…” from the menu.</p>
<h2 id="NPM-init"><a href="#NPM-init" class="headerlink" title="NPM init"></a>NPM init</h2><p>Much like NuGet’s packages.config file, NPM uses a json file to keep track of what should be installed.  To create this file, run the command <code>npm init</code> and answer the questions.</p>
<p>Next, in Visual Studio, click the “Show all files” icon in Solution Explorer, find the package.json file that you just created with the <code>npm init</code> command, and include the package.json file in your project.  This will cause it to be part of your commit so that anyone who pulls your code down from version control will have the packages installed automatically.</p>
<h2 id="Install-Gulp"><a href="#Install-Gulp" class="headerlink" title="Install Gulp"></a>Install Gulp</h2><p>Once you’ve shelled out to the command prompt, you’ll need to type in the following two commands.</p>
<figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install gulp -g</span><br><span class="line">npm install gulp --save-dev</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>If you open your package.json file now, you will see an entry for gulp.</p>
<h2 id="Create-a-Gulp-task"><a href="#Create-a-Gulp-task" class="headerlink" title="Create a Gulp task"></a>Create a Gulp task</h2><p>The final step in this process is to create the actual Gulp job.  To do that, all you need to do is create a gulpfile.js file in the root of the project.</p>
<p>Inside the gulpfile.js file, add the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> gulp = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'gulp'</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">gulp.task(<span class="string">'default'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// place code for your default task here</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And now you have a default task for gulp installed.</p>
<h2 id="Make-Gulp-Part-of-the-Build"><a href="#Make-Gulp-Part-of-the-Build" class="headerlink" title="Make Gulp Part of the Build"></a>Make Gulp Part of the Build</h2><p>The final step here is that we want to make gulp part of the build.  Otherwise, what’s the point? In Visual Studio 2015, this is really rather simple.</p>
<p>From the main menu, go to “View” &gt; “Other Windows” &gt; “Task Runner Explorer”.  You should end up looking a a sub windows in Visual Studio that looks like this: <img src="/uploads/2016/01/image-4.png" alt="image" title="image"> In gulp, you might have multiple tasks in a gulp file. We only have one right now, “default”.  If you right click on that, you will see that you can bind that task to one of the four bindings on the right.</p>
<p>That’s all you have to do.  Now the gulp task “default” is bound to a specific build step.  You can do all kinds of file processing with this which we may cover in a later post.  But for now, you can at least get it all wired in.</p>

        <p>I’ve searched all over the Internet for a Cross Browser JavaScript Copy and Paste solution.  I couldn’t find anything that really worked.  But I was able to put together the bits and pieces I found into a rather simple solutions. As you may have noticed, I’ve written <a href="/tags/javascript/">quite a few articles about programming in JavaScript</a> in the past couple of years because I’ve spent most of my time programming in JavaScript.  For the last three months, I’ve been working on a browser based application that needed to be able to copy and paste between the browser and an external spreadsheet.  The main struggle in making this all work correct is that what needs to be copied to the clipboard is the underlying data of the application.</p>
<p>Getting this all working in IE, even the most recent version that runs under Windows 10, was pretty easy.  And fortunately, the browser of choice at this company is Internet Explorer.  But, it is IE 11, which takes twice as long to do anything with JavaScript as Chrome does.  Chrome is their secondary browser and my mission has been to find a way to get copy and paste working reliably using Chrome so that the end user would have a better experience with the application.</p>
<p>While the work I’ve been doing has been using Angular, the solution that I provide in this article using plain JavaScript with no dependency on any framework.  I want the solution to be available regardless of what framework you might be predisposed to use.  If you use angular, or jQuery, or whatever, the code should be easy enough to adapt.</p>

<h2 id="Demo-HTML"><a href="#Demo-HTML" class="headerlink" title="Demo HTML"></a>Demo HTML</h2><p>For the purposes of this article, the HTML we are dealing with looks like this:</p>

<p>The <code>tabindex</code> attribute makes the element focusable.  We’ll use the <code>id</code> in our JavaScript to bind event handlers to the element.</p>
<h2 id="Demo-CSS"><a href="#Demo-CSS" class="headerlink" title="Demo CSS"></a>Demo CSS</h2><p>This is the CSS that we are using in the code to layout the <code>DIV</code>s:</p>

<p>This is really simple CSS.  Just enough to layout the screen with the <code>DIV</code>s side by side.</p>
<h2 id="Trapping-CTRL-C-and-CTRL-V"><a href="#Trapping-CTRL-C-and-CTRL-V" class="headerlink" title="Trapping CTRL-C and CTRL-V"></a>Trapping CTRL-C and CTRL-V</h2><p>To start out with, we need a way of trapping the <code>CTRL-C</code> and <code>CTRL-V</code> keystrokes on the element we want to copy or paste or content into.  This is pretty standard JavaScript that anyone who has worked with JavaScript before should already be familiar with.</p>

<h2 id="Internet-Explorer"><a href="#Internet-Explorer" class="headerlink" title="Internet Explorer"></a>Internet Explorer</h2><p>You may have noticed that the code above is calling a copy function and a paste function that we have not declared yet.  That is where a lot of the magic happens.</p>
<p>Implementing copy and paste using Internet Explorer is pretty trivial.</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">paste</span>(<span class="params">target</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">   <span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="built_in">window</span>.clipboardData) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        target.innerText = <span class="built_in">window</span>.clipboardData</span><br><span class="line">            .getData(<span class="string">'Text'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">copy</span>(<span class="params">target</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span>(<span class="built_in">window</span>.clipboardData)&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">window</span>.clipboardData.setData(<span class="string">'Text'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">            target.innerText);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>However, keep in mind that this method has been deprecated.  But it gives us a place to start.</p>
<p>A better way to implement the copy, would be by using newer document.execCommand(‘copy’) because that method generally works well in all three of the major browsers.  </p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">copy</span>(<span class="params">target</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    target.select();</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">document</span>.execCommand(<span class="string">'copy'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="Chrome-amp-Firefox"><a href="#Chrome-amp-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Chrome &amp; Firefox"></a>Chrome &amp; Firefox</h2><p>But the problem with using this method is that in Chrome and Firefox, the copy command only works with elements that are editable.  In chrome the element doesn’t have to be visible and with Firefox it does.  This requires us to change our copy command so that it will work in all three browsers.</p>

<p>By making the text area 1 pixel wide, giving it no boarder, and making it transparent, it isn’t really visible to the user and it fulfills the requirements of all three browsers.</p>
<h2 id="But-What-about-Paste"><a href="#But-What-about-Paste" class="headerlink" title="But What about Paste?"></a>But What about Paste?</h2><p>OK.</p>
<p>Getting copy working in a three browsers is pretty trivial.  But, paste, on the other hand, is where all the tricks come into play.</p>
<p>In short, you can’t read from the clipboard during the keyboard event.  However, we can trap the system level paste event.  Sometimes.  The problem is that ‘sometimes’ quirk.</p>
<p>In Chrome the paste event will fire all of the time.  In Firefox, it will only fire when an editable field is on the screen.  Further, the paste event can only be bound to certain elements.  The only one we can be sure will always be available is the window element.  Capturing paste at the window level doesn’t tell us what element we should paste into.</p>
<p>But with a little JavaScript magic we can use the keyboard event handler in combination with a paste event handler to grab the contents from the clipboard and put the data where we want it.</p>
<p>We are going to need to put some variables in place that will hold</p>
<ol>
<li>A flag that will tell us that the paste event has fired.</li>
<li>A variable to hold the data from the clipboard that we retrieve.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the paste event fires, we will set these two variables. Meanwhile, back in our paste event, we will setup a timeout function that will look to see if the flag has been set, and if it has it will retrieve the data from the data variable and place it into the DIV.</p>
<p>Oh.  And we have that issue that the paste event will only fire if an editable field is on the screen.  Fortunately, paste fires after the keydown event.  So as part of our keydown event, we will dynamically create a textarea to enable the paste event for Firefox.</p>
<p>So our paste code for Chrome and FireFox looks like this:</p>

<h2 id="Back-to-Internet-Explorer"><a href="#Back-to-Internet-Explorer" class="headerlink" title="Back to Internet Explorer"></a>Back to Internet Explorer</h2><p>I know what you are thinking now.  Why not make Internet Explorer work the same way?  Yeah, I thought the same thing.  But as soon as you take out the lnternet Explorer specific paste code, you get an exception in the paste event handler.  Turns out, the only way the paste event works is if you access the clipboard.getData() method.  At least, that’s how it works today.  So, I’m just leaving that code as it is.</p>

        <p>Today I saw a GREEN traffic light for the first time.</p>
<p>OK, that’s not entirely true.  What I mean to say is that I saw that it was green.</p>
<p>You see, I was born color blind.  This never really bothered me because, like most people who are handicapped from birth, I didn’t know what I was missing.</p>
<p>But then, I found out that there is this company that sells glasses that help color blind people see color.  They are pretty expensive, at least they seem pretty expensive when you believe you don’t really have a big problem.  But then I took the standard color blind test on their site and found out</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m color blind (duh!)</li>
<li>there is an 80% chance that the glasses would help and</li>
<li>I only see 2% of the available color spectrum.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wow! Only 2%?  I knew I had issues.  But I’ve been able to function.  But only 2%.  What am I missing?</p>
<p>Well, my wife got me a pair of glasses for Christmas.  Unfortunately, I ordered indoor/computer glasses and what they sent are sunglasses.  I’m still trying to get that resolved. <img src="/uploads/2016/01/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile">  But just for kicks, I wore the sunglasses out while I was running errands today.  This is the first sunny day that I haven’t been stuck inside since Christmas.  The reds are redder, the yellows are yellower and, hey! Guess what?!  The green light is actually green!</p>
<p>So, what’s this got to do with programming?  You did know this was going to eventually relate to programming right?</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2016/01/image.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>Most of us program with only 2% of what’s available.  And like those of us who are color blind, we don’t think it is an issue because, somehow, we manage to get the job done.</p>
<p>Just off the top of my head, here are some ways this applies.</p>
<h2 id="Know-What-You-Know"><a href="#Know-What-You-Know" class="headerlink" title="Know What You Know!"></a>Know What You Know!</h2><p>This is most evident with JavaScript, but I think most of us program this way with every language we use.  Since this is primarily a .NET blog, let’s just focus on JavaScript and C#.</p>
<p>JavaScript has some pretty amazing features once you get your head around them.  For example, how does “inheritance” really work in JavaScript?  Do you know, can you explain it?  Or do you just use JavaScript as an “object based” language, much like we used VB6?  Do you understand how JavaScript shims work or why they work?  Do you know what a closure is and how they can cause trouble if you aren’t careful?  Do you know when variables get declared?  All difficult questions to answer, because in some cases, you probably think you do but really don’t.  Just like I thought I was seeing fine.</p>
<p>Or if you’ve been using C#.  Do you know what the yield keyword does?  How about var?  Ever seen nameof()? Did you bother to learn LINQ? The problem I see with so many of my peers is that once they’ve learned enough to get the job done, they stop learning.  New version of the language comes out?  Do they learn it?  Nope.</p>
<p>Instead, the programmers who excel are the ones who are always learning.  It isn’t enough that they can get the job done.  They have to understand the tools they are using to the fullest extent possible.</p>
<h2 id="Ask-Why"><a href="#Ask-Why" class="headerlink" title="Ask Why"></a>Ask Why</h2><p>Here’s another place this shows up.</p>
<p>I’ve had this similar discussion twice now, now that single page applications are the hot new thing on the web.  Where do our business rules go?  I had one manager assert, “Let’s all agree on one thing.  Business rules belong on the server!” Well, maybe.</p>
<p>What do you mean by “business rule”? Why do you think this is true? In a closed corporate system, does it really make sense to make multiple calls back to the server when it can be done faster on the client? I’m not saying they belong on the client side.  I’m just saying they don’t necessarily belong on the server either. But here’s the real problem.  If you’ve stopped asking “why?” and just assert that something is true because someone convinced you this was true 5 years ago (or longer), you’re making decisions like I’ve been seeing color.  If you ask me what color the grass is, I’ll tell you “green” with our without my fancy new glasses because, just like the traffic like, I’ve been told “green” is the correct answer.</p>
<h2 id="Ask-How"><a href="#Ask-How" class="headerlink" title="Ask How"></a>Ask How</h2><p>I’ve run into this, hard core, twice in my career and I’m always shocked when I do.</p>
<p>I once knew a guy who, whenever I told him HOW to do something, he would do it HIS way until he finally stumbled on MY way.  What gave me the right to tell him how to do it?  I’d used the product before.  I knew what it could and couldn’t do.  He hadn’t.</p>
<p>More recently, I was talking to a programmer who actually told me, “I just want to be left alone.  I’ll figure it out.  I don’t need any help.” What?  Really? I can understand getting into a situation where you don’t know who you could ask for help.  Or being so focused on the problem that you don’t know you need help.  But flat out stating that you don’t need help?  The only time I’ve ever run into people who won’t ask for help are kids that just graduated from college.  And even that is changing with colleges focused on teaching students to collaborate instead of “doing their own work.”  But to hear this from a seasoned programmer?  That’s just ridiculous.</p>
<p>If you aren’t asking for help, you are definitely not working at full capacity.</p>
<h2 id="Stay-Young"><a href="#Stay-Young" class="headerlink" title="Stay Young"></a>Stay Young</h2><p>I’m not saying this doesn’t exist in other sectors.  But every time I hear someone say they can’t get a programming job because they are over 50, I think to myself, “really?!”  Because I’ve been in multiple situations where I know of hiring managers who would hire martins if they knew they could do more than spell “programming”.</p>
<p>I would submit to you that most people who can’t get a programming job either 1) never really were “programmers” in the strictest sense of the word.  Oh, yeah, they might have gotten some work done.  But can they solve problems?  Or 2) they were able to program once in a language that no one ever uses but they never kept their skills up to date.  They are still programming VB6 in a VB.NET world.  Or HTML3.2 in an HTML5 world.  Never learned to use external stylesheets.  Using JavaScript as though it is still a toy.</p>
<p>Maybe this is harsh.  But since I’m over 50 and got a job as recently as three months ago, it isn’t like I don’t have any experience with this. Maybe you aren’t 50 yet.  Here’s my advice to you.  Always be learning.  Listen to podcast.  Subscribe to blogs and read the articles.  Read programming books.  Learn new languages.  Get a PluralSight subscription. Tons of ways for you to learn and make yourself better. Best of all, you won’t need a new pair of glasses to “see” more than 2% of your programming career.</p>

        <p>Those who are relatively new to JavaScript might have the impression that JavaScript has no variable types.  After all, we declare everything using var and we can treat</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>(<span class="number">1</span> == <span class="string">"1"</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>But the reality is that JavaScript includes a very rich typing system with some well-known, and some little know methods of detecting types and converting from one type to another.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2015/12/image-2.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Strings-and-String-Conversion"><a href="#Strings-and-String-Conversion" class="headerlink" title="Strings and String Conversion"></a>Strings and String Conversion</h2><p>The three most familiar types included in JavaScript are the String, Number, and Boolean types.  And one of the oldest tricks in JavaScript is the ability to convert a number to a string simply by concatenating a number on to a string.</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> someNumber = <span class="number">2</span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> someString = <span class="string">'abc'</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> newString = someString + someNumber;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(newString); <span class="comment">// 'abc2'</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In fact, anytime we “add” anything to a string, it turns it into a string</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> someTruth = <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> someString = <span class="string">'abc'</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> newString = someString + someTruth;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(newString); <span class="comment">// 'abctrue';</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And it doesn’t matter where we put the string.</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> someTruth = <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> someString = <span class="string">'abc'</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> newString =  someTruth + someString;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(newString); <span class="comment">// 'trueabc';</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="Numbers-and-Number-Conversion"><a href="#Numbers-and-Number-Conversion" class="headerlink" title="Numbers and Number Conversion"></a>Numbers and Number Conversion</h2><p>But what happens if the string contains a number and we add that to a number?  Well, it depends.</p>

<p>Why? Well, prefixing the string variable with + converts that string to a number.  Under the hood, it is the same as if we had used the Number function to convert the string to a number.</p>

<h2 id="Boolean-and-Boolean-Conversion"><a href="#Boolean-and-Boolean-Conversion" class="headerlink" title="Boolean and Boolean Conversion"></a>Boolean and Boolean Conversion</h2><p>Last week, I discussed <a href="/javascript-truthy-and-falsy-pain-and-pleasure/">Truthiness and Falsiness in JavaScript</a>, but this week, I want to step back and discuss Booleans in the context of type information.</p>
<p>You can convert any type to a Boolean value simply by putting a bang in front of it</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>(!anyVariable)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>It doesn’t just invert the truthiness or falsiness of anyVariable, it actually converts it to a Boolean first and then inverts the Boolean value. In some code, you may see</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>(!!anyVariable)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>because the person who wrote the code wants to test a Boolean value for true or false and not the truthiness of a non-Boolean value.  In my opinion, you don’t really gain anything by using this syntax.  But since you are likely to see it used by people who don’t really understand what JavaScript does under the hood without it, and think they are being more explicit and therefore making JavaScript faster (which they aren’t on both points) I include the syntax for completeness.</p>

        <p>If you’ve been working with JavaScript at all for any length of time, you should know by now some of the basic rules of when something is true or false.  And yet, I still see code that messes this up. At the most simple level I see code that often looks like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> trueVariable = <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (trueVariable == <span class="literal">true</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'what a surprise, it is true!'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>But the person who wrote this code, could have just as easily, and just as clearly written:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> trueVariable = <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (trueVariable) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'what a surprise, it is true!'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Unless, of course, they wanted to know that the variable was both truthy and a boolean. In which case neither of the two code snippets above would be correct.  In that case, you would want to write the code like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> trueVariable = <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (trueVariable === <span class="literal">true</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'what a surprise, it is true!'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>What do we mean by “truthy” or “falsy”? <img src="/uploads/2015/12/image-1.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Truthy-Falsy-Basics"><a href="#Truthy-Falsy-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Truthy/Falsy Basics"></a>Truthy/Falsy Basics</h2><p>JavaScript treats any of the following values as “falsy”.</p>
<ul>
<li>null</li>
<li>undefined</li>
<li>0</li>
<li>NaN (Not a Number.  The value, not the type)</li>
<li>an empty length string (‘’, or “”)</li>
<li>false</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else is truthy. Here are some code snippets that demonstrate the rules.</p>

<p>Mostly, writing our code like this adds a bit of convenience.  And yet, these shortcuts can also introduce unintended side effects.</p>
<h2 id="Truthy-Falsy-Dangers"><a href="#Truthy-Falsy-Dangers" class="headerlink" title="Truthy/Falsy Dangers"></a>Truthy/Falsy Dangers</h2><p>For example, I recently ran into some code that looks like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (!obj.min) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    obj.min = <span class="string">'NA'</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The intention of this code is that if min was null, or had not been defined on the object, we would set the property to ‘NA’.  But what if min is defined as 0?  In that case, we want to leave min as it is.  But this code will reset the value to ‘NA’ which is not at all what we wanted. There are several ways you might fix this code depending on what the surrounding code might look like. You might add a check to see if obj.min is numeric, but what if it accidentally got set to a string?  You might try converting obj.min to a number and then testing the type.  Remember, a string that isn’t numeric converts to NaN. In this case, I think the best solution is to test for exactly what we intended.  Is it not null and not undefined?</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> obj = &#123; <span class="attr">min</span>: <span class="number">0</span> &#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (obj.min === <span class="literal">null</span> ||</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">typeof</span> obj.min === <span class="string">'undefined'</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    obj.min = <span class="string">'NA'</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In fact, I use this code so much that I have created a utility class that has this as a function.</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">isNullOrUndefined</span>(<span class="params">v</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (v === <span class="literal">null</span> ||</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">typeof</span> v === <span class="string">'undefined'</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">false</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="What-About"><a href="#What-About" class="headerlink" title="What About !"></a>What About !</h2><p>One final place you may get confused working with truthy and falsy is using the not operator, !. Just one quick simple example.  What if we take one of our first examples and place a ! in front of the variable we are testing?</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (!noneExistantVariable) &#123;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Is this truthy or falsy? You may be inclined to think that this is still falsy because the noneExistantVariable is still undefined and putting a ! in front of it will not change the fact.  But, what you may not realize is that the ! converts the expression to a boolean and the expression !noneExistantVariable is not just truthy, but is in fact the boolean value true.</p>

        <p>Every week when I write, I try to think back on the past week and think, “What have I learned that might be useful to others.”  Most weeks that is a pretty easy question to answer because I get most of my pleasure from learning new stuff.  But this week was different. When I sat down to write today, I couldn’t come up with a subject that couldn’t be covered with a sentence.  More of a tweet than a blog post.  It was so bad that I decided to go run the errands that are on my list and come back to it once I got home. Evidently, that was a good move because I think I have something that will be genuinely useful.  Although I will admit that if you’ve been working with Angular for very long at all, you may have already learned what I’m about to explain. <img src="/uploads/2015/11/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h2><p>To make sure we are all on the same page, I want to cover the basics first.  Every controller has a $scope variable associated with it.  $scopes can be nested within each other, which allows us to either have child scopes add information to parent scopes using prototypical inheritance, or the child $scope can be isolated so that it can’t see the parent $scope up the nesting chain.  In either case, you can gain access to the parent $scope by using the $parent variable. What is important to realize about $scope is that it is attached to the element’s this pointer.  Every controller you create is its own object and $scope is just one of many properties that is part of that object. Now, in normal Angular programming, you may only ever create one controller per element.  But if you’ve ever created a directive that gets used on multiple places, or you’ve done anything with repeaters, you know that controllers can be created “under the hood.”  So that the $scope for the repeater item isn’t the same as the $scope for the element that holds the main collection.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-ControllerAs"><a href="#scope-and-ControllerAs" class="headerlink" title="$scope and ControllerAs"></a>$scope and ControllerAs</h2><p>In version 1.2 of Angular, the ControllerAs syntax was added, this can be added in a number of different ways that I won’t describe here.  That’s old news and there are plenty of places to find that information, including the Angular documentation.  But what isn’t clear at first, is what this feature does for us under the hood. Many people, who haven’t dug in deep under the hood assume that somehow this replaces $scope.  But in fact what it does is that it adds a variable onto $scope.  If you were to use ControllerAs redMonkey, what actually happens under the hood is that you end up with a variable named “redMonkey” that is hanging off of the controller’s $scope variable. In fact, what you end up with is this holding a property “$scope” and $scope holding a property “redMonkey” which is actually pointing to the controller’s this pointer.  Further, it is possible to have elements in your view bind to other variables hanging off of $scope while in the same view, other things are bound to variables hanging off of redMonkeys.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-Singletons"><a href="#scope-and-Singletons" class="headerlink" title="$scope and Singletons"></a>$scope and Singletons</h2><p>I hope at this point you have a relatively clear picture of how $scope works because this is where things start to get interesting.  You see, just about everything else that you create in Angular is a singleton.  That is, only one instance of it exist in the entire application.  So, what happens if you pass $scope into one of these singletons and you use that singleton multiple times on the same page? Well, there’s no telling for sure.  You might get lucky and everything will seem to work, until one day it doesn’t.  In fact, you may never notice that there is a problem if you only ever call it from one controller or directive at a time. But to use singletons effectively, what you need to do is that you will need to pass the scope to each of the functions you need to have use it, unless you can be sure it will only be able to use one scope at a time.  As a general rule, you should never store state in anything that is a singleton. How do I know? Well, this week, I was working on some code that I thought was overriding the control’s controller.  But, when I finally got it all working I found that it only worked some of the time because what I had really overridden was a method in a directive.  Another time this week, I was doing something similar thinking I was overriding a function in the main control’s $scope only to find out that the function I was overloading was in a nested repeater item.</p>
<h2 id="Finding-scope-for-an-element"><a href="#Finding-scope-for-an-element" class="headerlink" title="Finding $scope for an element"></a>Finding $scope for an element</h2><p>If you need help figuring out what $scope is bound to what element in your code, you can use the <a href="//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk?hl=en">Batarang plugin</a>.  You can also use the following JavaScript code using any developer tool you might want to use.</p>
<p>angular.element(elementSelector).scope()</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-Repeaters"><a href="#scope-and-Repeaters" class="headerlink" title="$scope and Repeaters"></a>$scope and Repeaters</h2><p>So, back to one of my issues this week.  What I was working with was a tree control.  The tree was a set of repeaters within repeaters.  The original function that was bound to the click event was bound to the item scope so that each item was bound to its own instance of the onClick method. What I was trying to do was to override the function with a function in a directive I had created that wrapped the tree control and added a search box.  Fortunately, the item template could be changed, but how to get it to call MY click handler instead of the one it called by default? To further complicate matters, the $scope in the directives were isolated so I couldn’t add a new function on the scope I had control over and have the child scope see it. Or could I? The directive I was creating does have access to the scope of the tree control.  So, all I really needed to do was to create a new variable hanging off the tree control’s scope that pointed to the scope I wanted it to see and then in my template I could point to that variable and the function hanging off of it as the thing that should get called on click. Sure enough, that worked.</p>

        <p>When I first wrote down the idea for this post, I was originally thinking about how we might use agile development practices in a work place that practices Water Fall or worse.  But since then, I’ve expanded my thinking to include the concept of using agile everywhere, including where it “isn’t allowed.” Here’s what I’m talking about.  What does your work environment look like?  Many of the places I end up working either are using no formal process at all, or weakly attempt some form of Scrum or Water Fall.  In fact, my current major gig has a “project manager” (I use the term loosely) that manages our project with MS Project.  There is not even a formal issue tracking system.  And this is at a very LARGE organization that SHOULD know better. <img src="/uploads/2015/11/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Agile-in-an-Anti-Agile-Environment"><a href="#Agile-in-an-Anti-Agile-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Agile in an Anti-Agile Environment"></a>Agile in an Anti-Agile Environment</h2><h3 id="Kanban-Board"><a href="#Kanban-Board" class="headerlink" title="Kanban Board"></a>Kanban Board</h3><p>Now, I’m not saying I’m the most organized guy on the planet.  In fact, in an environment like this, it would be easy to just go with the flow.  But I know me well enough to know that if I don’t have a place to keep track of the task I need to accomplish, something will fall through the cracks.  So, I got permission to use <a href="/trello">Trello</a> along with the <a href="/plusForTrello">Plus for Trello</a> plugin on Chrome so that I can at least track the task that have been assigned to me. Trello, for those who don’t know, allows you to setup a basic Kanban board and configure it any way you would like.  From the basic, “To do”, “In Progress”, “Done” format to something more in line with your actual work flow.  For this project, I have “Back Log”, “On Hold”, “Up Next”, “In Progress”, “Done This Week” and “Done”.  Yeah, that’s a lot of columns.  But I want to be able to keep track of where my task are at that level.  The beauty of Trello is that you can configure it however you want. Plus For Trello builds on that and allows you to add estimates to each of your Trello Cards.  While they refer to the estimate as “hours” I just translate that to “Effort Points” and track how much effort I think I’ve completed rather than how many hours I’ve actually worked. Between the two, I can track how far along in the project I am, how many effort points I tend to complete each week, and I’m the only one on the team who can give a reasonable guess as to when I will be done with this project I am working on.  And when I need to change the estimates, I can show when they changed and why.</p>
<h3 id="Productivity-Hacks"><a href="#Productivity-Hacks" class="headerlink" title="Productivity Hacks"></a>Productivity Hacks</h3><p>But agile isn’t just about Kanban boards and accurate estimates.  Agile is about becoming better.  So, what are some ways you can become better at work without being any more disruptive than you have to be?  Here are some ways that have been effective for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use the Pomodoro technique</strong>. The <a href="/pomodoro">Pomodoro</a> technique is a technique that has you highly focused on the task at hand for 25 minutes at a time.  No interruptions for email, social media, coffee.  That’s for the breaks or their own Pomodoro.  After 25 minutes of work, you get a 5 minute break.  Sometimes I just sit in my chair and close my eyes.  Kind of a mini nap.  The routine has you do 4 Pomodoros and then rest for 15 minutes instead of 5.  If you take a lunch, you should take your lunch break during one of the longer Pomodoros.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Distractions</strong> I don’t know about you, but the last time I had the luxury of an office was 2.5 years ago when I was working from home.  I miss those days.  But now I close my virtual door by putting on headphones and listening to <a href="//t.co/EgPhHCQqLE">this Pandora station that I created</a> along with using the <a href="/brainwave">BrainWave</a> iPhone app set to “Problem Solving” for 25 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Batch E-mail</strong> As I said before, don’t check email while you are working.  I check mine during the Pomodoro breaks.  If you get more than what you can handle during the breaks you should create a Pomodoro for them.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule Your Day!</strong> OK, this may or may not work for you depending on your environment.  But, it is worth a try.  Personally, I know that my best hours are in the morning and that I start losing my concentration around 1:30.  I start my day at around 7am.  Ideally, if you want me to be productive, you won’t schedule meetings prior to 1:30.  So, I went into outlook and scheduled myself as “Busy” from 7am to 1:30pm.  Now when someone looks to see when I am available, they will see that I am available from 1:30 to 3:30. You might object that this is not being honest.  But I would argue that it is if you honestly believe that keeping appointments with yourself is as important as keeping appointments with other people.  It is just a matter of perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Turn Off Your Phone</strong>! OK, I’m assuming you are all programmers and not sales people.  But, I would go so far as to say that the only time you should answer your phone is when you have an appointment.  I stopped answering my phone YEARS ago.  Most of the calls that I got were either sales calls or recruiters.  Then I finally got smart and created a silent ring tone for my phone.  That is my default ring tone.  And my default vibrate pattern is no vibration at all.  I don’t even know that my phone rang until I look at my phone and it says I have a missed call. But, I can hear you say, I might miss something important.  Well, yes, there are calls that I don’t want to miss.  For those, I assign real ring tones.  Everyone in my family and some VERY close friends, all get a real ring tone that makes a sound. What about potential clients?  Well, first I schedule the call via email, if I even determine it is necessary, and second I ask for the number they will be calling from so that I can assign a ring tone to that number. I wish I could do something similar with my desk phone at work.  I answered it yesterday only to have it be a sales call.  I should have known better!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Agile-Home"><a href="#Agile-Home" class="headerlink" title="Agile Home"></a>Agile Home</h2><p>There is a whole course on PluralSight about being an <a href="/agileFamilies">Agile Family</a>.  I’m not talking about that.  I’m talking about being personally Agile at home just like I am suggesting that you can be personally Agile at work, regardless of the environment.</p>
<h3 id="Kanban-Again"><a href="#Kanban-Again" class="headerlink" title="Kanban Again"></a>Kanban Again</h3><p>Yep, I use Trello at home too.  But not the Plus for Trello plugin.  At least not yet.  I have a list that keeps track of my exercise rotation.  I have a list for Saturday.  I have a list of chores I need to do.  I have others, but those are the ones that I use regularly.</p>
<h3 id="Schedules"><a href="#Schedules" class="headerlink" title="Schedules"></a>Schedules</h3><p>I schedule my whole day.  This probably sounds more extreme than it is.  I was finding that not having a schedule, especially after work, was actually preventing me from getting stuff done that I really wanted to get done. Here are tips for scheduling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you really want something to get done, schedule it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Don’t schedule every last minute</strong>. For example, I know it generally takes me 45 minutes to get home.  But I also know bad traffic could make that longer.  So I don’t plan the next activity after work until 4:45.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule your Kanban list</strong>. I’m assuming your Kanban list are projects that you want to get done.  Well, if you really want them to get done, when are you going to work on them?</li>
<li><strong>Don’t try to do too much</strong>. Once I started scheduling, I realized I was trying to accomplish way more than was physically possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schedules are a great way for you to determine, ahead of time, what is most important to you.  Once that decision has been made, it is just a matter of execution.  If there are other things you’d like to be able to do, put them on the back log.</p>
<h2 id="The-Point"><a href="#The-Point" class="headerlink" title="The Point"></a>The Point</h2><p>So what’s the point of all of this?  Don’t wait on someone else.  You can be agile even if/when others aren’t. How are you being agile?</p>

        <p>For months now I have been suffering from the dreaded random computer freeze.  It has gotten progressively worse.  Everything I’ve tried to do to fix the problem has failed.  I know what you’re thinking too.  “Must be a virus.”  Yeah, except I have run multiple virus checkers and come up empty.  I read someplace else that maybe it was a driver issue.  OK, but which driver?  Memory?  I guess that is possible, but not likely.  I’ll admit that is one thing I didn’t check. The great thing about this issue is that it has caused me to write better code, because the code I’m currently working on would fail as it was writing to the database, even though the database is on the same computer.  So, now I make it try three times, with 2 minutes in between, before giving up.  Fortunately, it isn’t a routine that NEEDS to be fast.  In fact, it is better if it is not. <img src="/uploads/2015/11/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Another-Problem"><a href="#Another-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Another Problem"></a>Another Problem</h2><p>I’ve also noticed, more recently, that the CTRL key on my keyboard doesn’t want to work.  CTRL-C and CTRL-V often result in “c” or “v” being typed out unless I’m really intentional about pressing the keys.  Not the best way to go about programming.  Fortunately, I’m not using this computer to do my regular work (I’m currently working on-site with the client’s computer).  So, for the little bit of usage, I could live with it.  Besides, I’m cheap. Now, when I first got <a href="/backlitKeyboard">this keyboard</a>, I was really impressed.  The backlit keyboard was cool, but what I really liked was the mechanical keys.  So much smoother.  So, I was a little disappointed when I was thinking about replacing it.  And if I did replace it, should I get another of the same kind, or should I get something else? So, I procrastinated.</p>
<h2 id="Enough-Is-Enough"><a href="#Enough-Is-Enough" class="headerlink" title="Enough Is Enough!"></a>Enough Is Enough!</h2><p>Finally, a couple of weeks ago, I got so tired of not being able to copy and paste correctly, that I broke down and went to Amazon to see what is currently available.  This is when the <a href="/logitechWave">Logitech Wave</a> series caught my eye. I’ve always liked the idea of ergonomic keyboards, but when I’ve tried the split keyboard, I just didn’t like them.  Yes, maybe I could get used to one.  But, I don’t want to have to get used to one.  The Logitech Wave is a nice compromise.  It FEELS mostly like a regular keyboard because the keys aren’t split.  But it has a slight curve or wave (hence the name) that conforms to what your fingers want to do instead of making your fingers comply with a straight row of keys.</p>
<h2 id="So-What-Is-It-Like"><a href="#So-What-Is-It-Like" class="headerlink" title="So What Is It Like?"></a>So What Is It Like?</h2><p>So far, I like it enough.  I can’t say if it helps with carpal tunnel because I don’t really suffer from that problem.  It is a keyboard, it wasn’t all that expensive. It is wireless, so I was able to get it setup without crawling under my desk (I did have to crawl under my desk to unplug the old keyboard!).  Honestly, the only issue I’ve had was during the setup.  I unpacked the keyboard and the mouse (it comes with a wireless mouse) and realized, I didn’t know where the receiver part was that plugs into a USB port.  I looked back in the box for it, was it in one of the bags I hadn’t opened yet?  No.  Hmm.  Where could it be? Oh, there it is.  Stuck in the cardboard.  Seriously, this thing is SO small, if you don’t pay attention, you could lose it.  And I almost did before I had ever even gotten it installed!</p>
<h2 id="What’s-This-Got-To-Do-With-Computer-Freezes"><a href="#What’s-This-Got-To-Do-With-Computer-Freezes" class="headerlink" title="What’s This Got To Do With Computer Freezes?"></a>What’s This Got To Do With Computer Freezes?</h2><p>Over the rest of the day, I noticed, my computer isn’t freezing any more.  Maybe I’m just imagining things. But, I’ve been using this, as of this writing, for over a week.  I’ve used it for at least 2 hours every night.  I’m using it now to write this post.  I wrote last week’s post.  Seriously, my computer no longer freezes.  Whoda thunk?</p>

        <p>I’ve written that <a href="/tags/angular-js/">I’m using Angular</a> to write a couple applications before.  One at my main contract and a couple side projects.  I know I’m kind of late to the game, but one of my frustrations with the documentation around Angular is that very little of the sample code that you can find on the Internet shows the sample using anything close to a best practice.  That’s the danger of writing about something you are too familiar with. So, in this post, I’d like to cover a few best practices that I’ve discovered, or implemented in my own code, and explain in a bit more detail what is going on inside the controller.  I concentrate on the controller because this is a place that will be used the most.  Once you understand it, the rest of what you need to know will trickle down to services, factories, and directives.</p>
<h2 id><a href="#" class="headerlink" title></a><img src="/uploads/2015/10/image4.png" alt="image" title="image"></h2><h2 id="IIFEs"><a href="#IIFEs" class="headerlink" title="IIFEs"></a>IIFEs</h2><p>The first thing you’ll almost never see in the demos, but you might pick up on eventually, is that you should always write your angular code inside of and IIFE.  What’s an IIFE you ask?  IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression.  The most common looks like this:</p>
<p>(function(){<br>    // your code goes here<br>})();</p>
<p>Why do we do this?  So that we can declare variables that are “global” to everything inside of the IIFE without polluting the global namespace.  If you follow the rest of the tips in this article, you shouldn’t end up writing any kind of global variables.  But, there is another good reason for using an IIFE.  You can pass parameters into it.  The most common implementation I use is that I pass any global variables I need for the code inside as parameters.  This keeps JSHint happy without having to specify global variables as comments or putting them in a configuration file.  Since “angular”:</p>
<p>(function(angular){<br> // your code goes here<br>})(window.angular);</p>
<h2 id="Single-Responsibility-Applies-to-Files"><a href="#Single-Responsibility-Applies-to-Files" class="headerlink" title="Single Responsibility Applies to Files"></a>Single Responsibility Applies to Files</h2><p>Another big problem I see with a lot of samples, is that they mix controllers and directives and modules declarations all together.  At one level I get it, why separate them when it is just a small demo.  On the other hand, doing inadvertently promotes bad code to the masses. How much code have you seen that looks like:</p>
<p>var app = angular.module(‘app’, [<br>    // Angular modules<br>    // Custom modules<br>    // 3rd Party Modules<br>    ]);<br>app.config([‘<br>    function () {<br>        // code here<br>    });<br>angular.module(‘Controllers’).controller(‘Controller’,[ function () {<br>   // code here<br>    }]);<br>angular.module(‘Controllers’).controller(‘controllerName’,<br>    [‘$scope’, function ($scope)<br>    {<br>       // Code here<br>    }]);</p>
<p>When they should specify what should be in a separate file.  Maybe by wrapping them in IIFEs.</p>
<p>// top level app.js file<br>(function(angular){<br>angular.module(‘app’, [<br>    // Angular modules<br>    // Custom modules<br>    // 3rd Party Modules<br>    ]);<br>})(window.angular);</p>
<p>// config.js that lives in a file parallel to app.js<br>(function(angular){<br>angular.module(‘app’).config([‘ function () { // code here }); })(window.angular); // controllers holder that lives parallel to app.js (function(angular){ angular.module(‘Controllers’).controller(‘Controller’,[ function () { // code here }]); })(window.angular); // controller that lives parallel to the view it is associated with (function(angular){ angular.module(‘Controllers’).controller(‘controllerName’, [‘$scope’, function ($scope) { // Code here }]); })(window.angular);</p>
<h2 id="Namespace-Everything"><a href="#Namespace-Everything" class="headerlink" title="Namespace Everything"></a>Namespace Everything</h2><p>As I’ve already hinted at in the code above, I place my controllers and the views they are attached to in separate directories based on the route or state that I will use to get to them.  I use states, so to be clear the state does not necessarily represent the url that I will be using to access the view.  This works out pretty nicely because for every state, there is a directory and for every sub state, there is a sub directory.  Each directory generally has two files.  controller.js and view.html.  When I specify the name of the controller, I use dot notation to represent where it is in the directory structure.  Similarly, when I specify the state in app.config(), I use the same dot notation.  So if my state were ‘edit.contact’ you should expect to see a directory structure of ‘edit/contact’ with the two files inside of it.</p>
<h2 id="ControllerAs"><a href="#ControllerAs" class="headerlink" title="ControllerAs"></a>ControllerAs</h2><p>I’ve only seen this explained in one place (<a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight of course</a>) where this is explained in a way that I could grasp. Here’s the deal.  What you first need to understand is how the code you write in angular relates to the code you would write in JavaScript without the framework.  (BTW, one complaint I’ve heard from hiring managers is that while they can find people who can write Angular, they can’t find people who can write Angular AND understand JavaScript.  So much is hidden from us by using Angular.  If you want to be awesome at Angular, be awesome at JavaScript.) So, let’s sketch out a basic controller.</p>
<p>(function ()<br>{<br>    ‘use strict’;<br>    angular.module(‘Controllers’).controller(‘edit.contacts’,<br>        [‘$scope’, function ($scope)<br>    {<br>        // Your controller code here<br>    }]);</p>
<p>})();</p>
<p>What is happening here?  Well what you’ve essentially done is create an anonymous constructor for your controller.</p>
<p>Let’s rearrange some code so that you can see this more clearly.</p>
<p>(function ()<br>{<br>    ‘use strict’;</p>
<pre><code>editContacts.$inject = \[&apos;$scope&apos;\];
function editContacts($scope)
{
    // your code here
};

angular.module(&apos;Controllers&apos;).controller(&apos;edit.contacts&apos;, editContacts);
</code></pre><p>})();</p>
<p>So, now the code looks like regular JavaScript.  And if I told you that editContacts was the object constructor, the next thing that you might expect is that you could then write code that looked something like this:</p>
<p>(function ()<br>{<br>    ‘use strict’;</p>
<pre><code>editContacts.$inject = \[&apos;$scope&apos;\];
function editContacts($scope)
{
    var self = this;
    function someMethod(){
        self.variableName = &apos;foo&apos;;
    };

    self.someMethod = someMethod;
    // your code here
};

angular.module(&apos;Controllers&apos;).controller(&apos;edit.contacts&apos;, editContacts);
</code></pre><p>})();</p>
<p>This is the way I like to write JavaScript classes, but you can use any method you prefer.  It is just plain old JavaScript at this point. The other piece that might need some explaining is the ‘editContacts.$inject’ thing.  This is just an alternate way of specifying the services that need to be injected into your constructor.  I haven’t decided if I like using this way, or if I like having them specified in the controller definition at the bottom.  By leaving the injection at the bottom, I am left with code that looks mostly like plain old JavaScript.  By leaving them at the top, I can see that what I’m injecting matches the parameters I am expecting.  Of course, if you are willing to throw some external tools into the mix, you can have that line created for you automatically at build time. So, under the hood, what Angular is doing for you is looking for the controller by the name that you gave it and calling the function associated with it using the ‘new’ keyword.  If you want some of your functions and methods exposed to the view, you need to attach them to the $scope, which is why we need to inject it as a parameter to our constructor.  But, if you use the ControllerAs keyword, it assigns the object to a variable the the name you specified as the ‘As’ and attaches it to $scope.  What this means is that you almost never have to pass in the $scope object to your constructor and all of your public methods and fields are available to the view for free using the syntax ‘asName.variableName’.</p>
<h2 id="Using-Controllers-in-Directives"><a href="#Using-Controllers-in-Directives" class="headerlink" title="Using Controllers in Directives"></a>Using Controllers in Directives</h2><p>The final piece I want to talk about today gets back to my discussion about demos that don’t use good coding practices.  Most directive demos that use controllers write the controller inline.  But you don’t have to do it this way, and I would recommend that you don’t.  Controllers should be in their own file.  Separation of concerns and Single Responsibility.  You define  your controller just like you would any other controller in the separate file.  I define them using the controller function hanging off the directive object</p>
<p>directive(‘directiveName’)<br>    .controller(controllerDefinitionHere);</p>
<p>And then use the name of the directive in the controller property in my directive code.</p>

        <p>I heard this so frequently, I decided it is time to write about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(When writing web applications)  Business rules always belong on the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the last conversations I had at the last place I was working was on this same issue.  And, I had a similar reaction a couple of years ago when I was doing a Selenium testing presentation and mentioned that the organization I was currently working for put all of the code on the client side and that the only thing the server did was save the data. Maybe you believe the same thing? Nothing is ever that cut and dry. <img src="/uploads/2015/10/image3.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="First-Rule-of-Rhetoric"><a href="#First-Rule-of-Rhetoric" class="headerlink" title="First Rule of Rhetoric"></a>First Rule of Rhetoric</h2><p>Now, the first rule of rhetoric, and the rule you must always keep in mind is this.  Whenever someone states an absolute, it probably isn’t true.  Including this one <img src="/uploads/2015/10/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile">. Here’s the deal. At one point there were good reasons for not putting business rules on the client side.  Chief among them was that JavaScript was slow.  If if you accounted for the round trip time, performing business logic on the server was generally slower. Another reason it was nearly never a good idea to put the business rules on the client is that no one really knew how to write good, structured, testable JavaScript.  But JavaScript has grown up and this is not the problem it once was. And finally, and the only reason we have left, is that despite many attempts to obfuscate JavaScript, at the end of the day, JavaScript is available for anyone who wants to, to read and steal trade secrets from.  Things have gotten better, but the truth remains, if I really want to, I can figure out what your JavaScript code is doing.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-a-Business-Rule"><a href="#What-Is-a-Business-Rule" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Business Rule?"></a>What Is a Business Rule?</h2><p>OK, so I’ve shown that most of the old rules don’t exist.  We’ll come back to the third old rule later.  What I want to discuss is the chief, “it depends” issue. What, exactly, qualifies as a business rule? I have to admit, this question has bothered me for years.</p>
<h3 id="Three-Tiered"><a href="#Three-Tiered" class="headerlink" title="Three Tiered"></a>Three Tiered</h3><p>Take a look at a typical description of a three tiered architecture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>View &lt;–&gt; Business Rules &lt;–&gt; Data Access</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know about you, but most of the applications I work on, the business logic layer does little more than pass the data from the Data Access Layer up to the View and back again.  There MAY be some transformations along the way.  It might combine data in a particular way.  But, really, the Business Logic Layer, strictly speaking, isn’t doing anything I would be uncomfortable letting my competitors know about.  There are only a few instances where I could argue that putting that code on the server was going to speed things up in any significant way.</p>
<h3 id="Model-View-Whatever"><a href="#Model-View-Whatever" class="headerlink" title="Model View Whatever"></a>Model View Whatever</h3><p>Then there is the Model View Whatever patterns.  You know, MVC, MVVM, etc.  In this pattern, our business rules either get stuck in the controller or we put them in classes external to this pattern.  Often this code does little more than decide what elements should be enabled or disabled, assist in validation, and auto populate fields that the user could populate themselves but we do it to make life easier for them. Once again, I have to ask, what about a business rule needs to be hidden or would work faster if we put it on the server?</p>
<h2 id="Who-Is-Using-Your-Application"><a href="#Who-Is-Using-Your-Application" class="headerlink" title="Who Is Using Your Application?"></a>Who Is Using Your Application?</h2><p>Most web applications today are built by organizations to be used by themselves in Intranet environments.  In the last organization I worked for, there was no danger that someone would steal our code.  Most of them had no idea how to do it, and if they did, they wouldn’t be able to read it anyhow. By asking the question, “Who is using this application?” You are really asking, “What’s the risk of putting code on the client side?”  Most of the time for most of our code in most of the organizations, including even publicly facing web sites, there is very little risk involved in putting all of our code on the client side.</p>
<h2 id="Is-There-Any-Advantage"><a href="#Is-There-Any-Advantage" class="headerlink" title="Is There Any Advantage?"></a>Is There Any Advantage?</h2><p>Which comes down to the final question that needs to be asked.  Is there any advantage to putting code on the server instead of the client, or the other way around? In most cases, I think you will find, that the advantage of putting code on the client side far outweighs the advantages of putting that same code on the server side.  In some extreme cases, you may find that there is code that absolutely needs to live on the server.</p>
<h2 id="Maybe-I’m-Missing-Something"><a href="#Maybe-I’m-Missing-Something" class="headerlink" title="Maybe I’m Missing Something?"></a>Maybe I’m Missing Something?</h2><p>OK.  So, maybe I’m missing something.  Do you agree or not?  Why?  Leave a comment.</p>
