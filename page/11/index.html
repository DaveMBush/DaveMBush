        <p>I’ve searched all over the Internet for a Cross Browser JavaScript Copy and Paste solution.  I couldn’t find anything that really worked.  But I was able to put together the bits and pieces I found into a rather simple solutions. As you may have noticed, I’ve written <a href="/tags/javascript/">quite a few articles about programming in JavaScript</a> in the past couple of years because I’ve spent most of my time programming in JavaScript.  For the last three months, I’ve been working on a browser based application that needed to be able to copy and paste between the browser and an external spreadsheet.  The main struggle in making this all work correct is that what needs to be copied to the clipboard is the underlying data of the application. Getting this all working in IE, even the most recent version that runs under Windows 10, was pretty easy.  And fortunately, the browser of choice at this company is Internet Explorer.  But, it is IE 11, which takes twice as long to do anything with JavaScript as Chrome does.  Chrome is their secondary browser and my mission has been to find a way to get copy and paste working reliably using Chrome so that the end user would have a better experience with the application. While the work I’ve been doing has been using Angular, the solution that I provide in this article using plain JavaScript with no dependency on any framework.  I want the solution to be available regardless of what framework you might be predisposed to use.  If you use angular, or jQuery, or whatever, the code should be easy enough to adapt. <img src="/uploads/2016/01/image-1.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Demo-HTML"><a href="#Demo-HTML" class="headerlink" title="Demo HTML"></a>Demo HTML</h2><p>For the purposes of this article, the HTML we are dealing with looks like this:</p>
<body><br>    <div tabindex="0" id="element1"><br>        Element To Paste Into<br>    </div><br>    <div tabindex="0" id="element2"><br>        Another Element To Paste Into<br>    </div><br>    <script src="App/app.js"></script><br></body>

<p>The <code>tabindex</code> attribute makes the element focusable.  We’ll use the <code>id</code> in our JavaScript to bind event handlers to the element.</p>
<h2 id="Demo-CSS"><a href="#Demo-CSS" class="headerlink" title="Demo CSS"></a>Demo CSS</h2><p>This is the CSS that we are using in the code to layout the <code>DIV</code>s:</p>
<p>#element1 {<br>    width: 49%;<br>    height: 100px;<br>    float: left;<br>    border: 1px solid black;<br>}</p>
<p>#element2 {<br>    width: 49%;<br>    height: 100px;<br>    float: right;<br>    border: 1px solid black;<br>}</p>
<p>This is really simple CSS.  Just enough to layout the screen with the <code>DIV</code>s side by side.</p>
<h2 id="Trapping-CTRL-C-and-CTRL-V"><a href="#Trapping-CTRL-C-and-CTRL-V" class="headerlink" title="Trapping CTRL-C and CTRL-V"></a>Trapping CTRL-C and CTRL-V</h2><p>To start out with, we need a way of trapping the <code>CTRL-C</code> and <code>CTRL-V</code> keystrokes on the element we want to copy or paste or content into.  This is pretty standard JavaScript that anyone who has worked with JavaScript before should already be familiar with.</p>
<p>function keyBoardListener(evt) {<br>    if (evt.ctrlKey) {<br>        switch(evt.keyCode) {<br>            case 67: // c<br>                copy(evt.target);<br>                break;<br>            case 86: // v<br>                paste(evt.target);<br>                break;<br>        }<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>document.getElementById(‘element1’)<br>    .addEventListener(‘keydown’, keyBoardListener);<br>document.getElementById(‘element2’)<br>    .addEventListener(‘keydown’, keyBoardListener);</p>
<h2 id="Internet-Explorer"><a href="#Internet-Explorer" class="headerlink" title="Internet Explorer"></a>Internet Explorer</h2><p>You may have noticed that the code above is calling a copy function and a paste function that we have not declared yet.  That is where a lot of the magic happens. Implementing copy and paste using Internet Explorer is pretty trivial.</p>
<p>function paste(target) {<br>   if (window.clipboardData) {<br>        target.innerText = window.clipboardData<br>            .getData(‘Text’);<br>        return;<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>function copy(target){<br>    if(window.clipboardData){<br>        window.clipboardData.setData(‘Text’,<br>            target.innerText);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that this method has been deprecated.  But it gives us a place to start. A better way to implement the copy, would be by using newer document.execCommand(‘copy’) because that method generally works well in all three of the major browsers.  </p>
<p>function copy(target){<br>    target.select();<br>    document.execCommand(‘copy’);<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Chrome-amp-Firefox"><a href="#Chrome-amp-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Chrome &amp; Firefox"></a>Chrome &amp; Firefox</h2><p>But the problem with using this method is that in Chrome and Firefox, the copy command only works with elements that are editable.  In chrome the element doesn’t have to be visible and with Firefox it does.  This requires us to change our copy command so that it will work in all three browsers.</p>
<p>function copy(target) {<br>    // standard way of copying<br>    var textArea = document.createElement(‘textarea’);<br>    textArea.setAttribute<br>        (‘style’,’width:1px;border:0;opacity:0;’);<br>    document.body.appendChild(textArea);<br>    textArea.value = target.innerHTML;<br>    textArea.select();<br>    document.execCommand(‘copy’);<br>    document.body.removeChild(textArea);<br>}</p>
<p>By making the text area 1 pixel wide, giving it no boarder, and making it transparent, it isn’t really visible to the user and it fulfills the requirements of all three browsers.</p>
<h2 id="But-What-about-Paste"><a href="#But-What-about-Paste" class="headerlink" title="But What about Paste?"></a>But What about Paste?</h2><p>OK. Getting copy working in a three browsers is pretty trivial.  But, paste, on the other hand, is where all of the tricks come into play. In short, you can’t read from the clipboard during the keyboard event.  However, we can trap the system level paste event.  Sometimes.  The problem is that ‘sometimes’ quirk. In Chrome the paste event will fire all of the time.  In Firefox, it will only fire when an editable field is on the screen.  Further, the paste event can only be bound to certain elements.  The only one we can be sure will always be available is the window element.  Capturing paste at the window level doesn’t tell us what element we should paste into. But with a little JavaScript magic we can use the keyboard event handler in combination with a paste event handler to grab the contents from the clipboard and put the data where we want it. We are going to need to put some variables in place that will hold</p>
<ol>
<li>A flag that will tell us that the paste event has fired.</li>
<li>A variable to hold the data from the clipboard that we retrieve.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the paste event fires, we will set these two variables. Meanwhile, back in our paste event, we will setup a timeout function that will look to see if the flag has been set, and if it has it will retrieve the data from the data variable and place it into the DIV. Oh.  And we have that issue that the paste event will only fire if an editable field is on the screen.  Fortunately, paste fires after the keydown event.  So as part of our keydown event, we will dynamically create a textarea to enable the paste event for Firefox. So our paste code for Chrome and FireFox looks like this:</p>
<p>function paste(target) {<br>    function waitForPaste() {<br>        if (!systemPasteReady) {<br>            setTimeout(waitForPaste, 250);<br>            return;<br>        }</p>
<pre><code>    target.innerHTML = systemPasteContent;
    systemPasteReady = false;
    document.body.removeChild(textArea);
    textArea = null;
}

// FireFox requires at least one editable
// element on the screen for the paste event to fire
textArea = document.createElement(&apos;textarea&apos;);
textArea.setAttribute
    (&apos;style&apos;, &apos;width:1px;border:0;opacity:0;&apos;);
document.body.appendChild(textArea);
textArea.select();
waitForPaste();
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>function systemPasteListener(evt) {<br>    systemPasteContent =<br>        evt.clipboardData.getData(‘text/plain’);<br>    systemPasteReady = true;<br>    evt.preventDefault();<br>}</p>
<p>window.addEventListener(‘paste’,systemPasteListener);</p>
<h2 id="Back-to-Internet-Explorer"><a href="#Back-to-Internet-Explorer" class="headerlink" title="Back to Internet Explorer"></a>Back to Internet Explorer</h2><p>I know what you are thinking now.  Why not make Internet Explorer work the same way?  Yeah, I thought the same thing.  But as soon as you take out the lnternet Explorer specific paste code, you get an exception in the paste event handler.  Turns out, the only way the paste event works is if you access the clipboard.getData() method.  At least, that’s how it works today.  So, I’m just leaving that code as it is. And there you have it.  Cross browser JavaScript Copy and Paste.</p>

        <p>Today I saw a GREEN traffic light for the first time. OK, that’s not entirely true.  What I mean to say is that I saw that it was green. You see, I was born color blind.  This never really bothered me because, like most people who are handicapped from birth, I didn’t know what I was missing. But then, I found out that there is this company that sells glasses that help color blind people see color.  They are pretty expensive, at least they seem pretty expensive when you believe you don’t really have a big problem.  But then I took the standard color blind test on their site and found out</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m color blind (duh!)</li>
<li>there is an 80% chance that the glasses would help and</li>
<li>I only see 2% of the available color spectrum.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wow! Only 2%?  I knew I had issues.  But I’ve been able to function.  But only 2%.  What am I missing? Well, my wife got me a pair of glasses for Christmas.  Unfortunately, I ordered indoor/computer glasses and what they sent are sunglasses.  I’m still trying to get that resolved. <img src="/uploads/2016/01/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile">  But just for kicks, I wore the sunglasses out while I was running errands today.  This is the first sunny day that I haven’t been stuck inside since Christmas.  The reds are redder, the yellows are yellower and, hey! Guess what?!  The green light is actually green! So, what’s this got to do with programming?  You did know this was going to eventually relate to programming right? <img src="/uploads/2016/01/image.png" alt="image" title="image">  Most of us program with only 2% of what’s available.  And like those of us who are color blind, we don’t think it is an issue because, somehow, we manage to get the job done. Just off the top of my head, here are some ways this applies.</p>
<h2 id="Know-What-You-Know"><a href="#Know-What-You-Know" class="headerlink" title="Know What You Know!"></a>Know What You Know!</h2><p>This is most evident with JavaScript, but I think most of us program this way with every language we use.  Since this is primarily a .NET blog, let’s just focus on JavaScript and C#. JavaScript has some pretty amazing features once you get your head around them.  For example, how does “inheritance” really work in JavaScript?  Do you know, can you explain it?  Or do you just use JavaScript as an “object based” language, much like we used VB6?  Do you understand how JavaScript shims work or why they work?  Do you know what a closure is and how they can cause trouble if you aren’t careful?  Do you know when variables get declared?  All difficult questions to answer, because in some cases, you probably think you do but really don’t.  Just like I thought I was seeing fine. Or if you’ve been using C#.  Do you know what the yield keyword does?  How about var?  Ever seen nameof()? Did you bother to learn LINQ? The problem I see with so many of my peers is that once they’ve learned enough to get the job done, they stop learning.  New version of the language comes out?  Do they learn it?  Nope. Instead.  The programmers who excel are the ones who are always learning.  It isn’t enough that they can get the job done.  They have to understand the tools they are using to the fullest extent possible.</p>
<h2 id="Ask-Why"><a href="#Ask-Why" class="headerlink" title="Ask Why"></a>Ask Why</h2><p>Here’s another place this shows up. I’ve had this similar discussion twice now, now that single page applications are the hot new thing on the web.  Where do our business rules go?  I had one manager assert, “Let’s all agree on one thing.  Business rules belong on the server!” Well, maybe. What do you mean by “business rule”? Why do you think this is true? In a closed corporate system, does it really make sense to make multiple calls back to the server when it can be done faster on the client? I’m not saying they belong on the client side.  I’m just saying they don’t necessarily belong on the server either. But here’s the real problem.  If you’ve stopped asking “why?” and just assert that something is true because someone convinced you this was true 5 years ago (or longer), you’re making decisions like I’ve been seeing color.  If you ask me what color the grass is, I’ll tell you “green” with our without my fancy new glasses because, just like the traffic like, I’ve been told “green” is the correct answer.</p>
<h2 id="Ask-How"><a href="#Ask-How" class="headerlink" title="Ask How"></a>Ask How</h2><p>I’ve run into this, hard core, twice in my career and I’m always shocked when I do. I once knew a guy who, whenever I told him HOW to do something, he would do it HIS way until he finally stumbled on MY way.  What gave me the right to tell him how to do it?  I’d used the product before.  I knew what it could and couldn’t do.  He hadn’t. More recently, I was talking to a programmer who actually told me, “I just want to be left alone.  I’ll figure it out.  I don’t need any help.” What?  Really? I can understand getting into a situation where you don’t know who you could ask for help.  Or being so focused on the problem that you don’t know you need help.  But flat out stating that you don’t need help?  The only time I’ve ever run into people who won’t ask for help are kids that just graduated from college.  And even that is changing with colleges focused on teaching students to collaborate instead of “doing their own work.”  But to hear this from a seasoned programmer?  That’s just ridiculous. If you aren’t asking for help, you are definitely not working at full capacity.</p>
<h2 id="Stay-Young"><a href="#Stay-Young" class="headerlink" title="Stay Young"></a>Stay Young</h2><p>I’m not saying this doesn’t exist in other sectors.  But every time I hear someone say they can’t get a programming job because they are over 50, I think to myself, “really?!”  Because I’ve been in multiple situations where I know of hiring managers who would hire martins if they knew they could do more than spell “programming”. I would submit to you that most people who can’t get a programming job either 1) never really were “programmers” in the strictest sense of the word.  Oh, yeah, they might have gotten some work done.  But can they solve problems?  Or 2) they were able to program once in a language that no one ever uses but they never kept their skills up to date.  They are still programming VB6 in a VB.NET world.  Or HTML3.2 in an HTML5 world.  Never learned to use external stylesheets.  Using JavaScript as though it is still a toy. Maybe this is harsh.  But since I’m over 50 and got a job as recently as three months ago, it isn’t like I don’t have any experience with this. Maybe you aren’t 50 yet.  Here’s my advice to you.  Always be learning.  Listen to podcast.  Subscribe to blogs and read the articles.  Read programming books.  Learn new languages.  Get a <a href="/pluralsight">PluralSight subscription</a>.  Check out <a href="/dave-recommends/">my resource section</a>.  Tons of ways for you to learn and make yourself better. Best of all, you won’t need a new pair of glasses to “see” more than 2% of your programming career.</p>

        <p>Those who are relatively new to JavaScript might have the impression that JavaScript has no variable types.  After all, we declare everything using var and we can treat</p>
<p>if(1 == “1”)</p>
<p>The same as</p>
<p>if(1 == 1)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>if(“1” == “1”)</p>
<p>But the reality is that JavaScript includes a very rich typing system with some well-known, and some little know methods of detecting types and converting from one type to another. <img src="/uploads/2015/12/image-2.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Strings-and-String-Conversion"><a href="#Strings-and-String-Conversion" class="headerlink" title="Strings and String Conversion"></a>Strings and String Conversion</h2><p>The three most familiar types included in JavaScript are the String, Number, and Boolean types.  And one of the oldest tricks in JavaScript is the ability to convert a number to a string simply by concatenating a number on to a string.</p>
<p>var someNumber = 2;<br>var someString = ‘abc’;</p>
<p>var newString = someString + someNumber;<br>console.log(newString); // ‘abc2’</p>
<p>In fact, anytime we “add” anything to a string, it turns it into a string</p>
<p>var someTruth = true;<br>var someString = ‘abc’;</p>
<p>var newString = someString + someTruth;<br>console.log(newString); // ‘abctrue’;</p>
<p>And it doesn’t matter where we put the string.</p>
<p>var someTruth = true;<br>var someString = ‘abc’;</p>
<p>var newString =  someTruth + someString;<br>console.log(newString); // ‘trueabc’;</p>
<h2 id="Numbers-and-Number-Conversion"><a href="#Numbers-and-Number-Conversion" class="headerlink" title="Numbers and Number Conversion"></a>Numbers and Number Conversion</h2><p>But what happens if the string contains a number and we add that to a number?  Well, it depends.</p>
<p>var someNumber = 9;<br>var someString = ‘3’;</p>
<p>var newString =  someString + someNumber;<br>console.log(newString); // ‘39’;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>var someNumber = 9;<br>var someString = ‘3’;</p>
<p>var newString =  someNumber + someString;<br>console.log(newString); // ‘93’;</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>var someNumber = 9;<br>var someString = ‘3’;</p>
<p>var newString =  someNumber + +someString;<br>console.log(newString); // 12;</p>
<p>Why? Well, prefixing the string variable with + converts that string to a number.  Under the hood, it is the same as if we had used the Number function to convert the string to a number.</p>
<p>var someNumber = 9;<br>var someString = ‘3’;</p>
<p>var newString =  someNumber + Number(someString);<br>console.log(newString); // 12;</p>
<p>But what if someString can’t be converted to a number?</p>
<p>var someNumber = 9;<br>var someString = ‘x’;</p>
<p>var newString =  someNumber + Number(someString);<br>console.log(newString); // NaN;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>var someNumber = 9;<br>var someString = ‘x’;</p>
<p>var newString =  someNumber + +someString;<br>console.log(newString); // NaN;</p>
<h2 id="Boolean-and-Boolean-Conversion"><a href="#Boolean-and-Boolean-Conversion" class="headerlink" title="Boolean and Boolean Conversion"></a>Boolean and Boolean Conversion</h2><p>Last week, I discussed <a href="/javascript-truthy-and-falsy-pain-and-pleasure/">Truthiness and Falsiness in JavaScript</a>, but this week, I want to step back and discuss Booleans in the context of type information. You can convert any type to a Boolean value simply by putting a bang in front of it</p>
<p>if(!anyVariable)</p>
<p>It doesn’t just invert the truthiness or falsiness of anyVariable, it actually converts it to a Boolean first and then inverts the Boolean value. In some code, you may see</p>
<p>if(!!anyVariable)</p>
<p>because the person who wrote the code wants to test a Boolean value for true or false and not the truthiness of a non-Boolean value.  In my opinion, you don’t really gain anything by using this syntax.  But since you are likely to see it used by people who don’t really understand what JavaScript does under the hood without it, and think they are being more explicit and therefore making JavaScript faster (which they aren’t on both points) I include the syntax for completeness.</p>

        <p>If you’ve been working with JavaScript at all for any length of time, you should know by now some of the basic rules of when something is true or false.  And yet, I still see code that messes this up. At the most simple level I see code that often looks like this:</p>
<p>var trueVariable = true;<br>if (trueVariable == true) {<br>    console.log(‘what a surprise, it is true!’);<br>}</p>
<p>But the person who wrote this code, could have just as easily, and just as clearly written:</p>
<p>var trueVariable = true;<br>if (trueVariable) {<br>    console.log(‘what a surprise, it is true!’);<br>}</p>
<p>Unless, of course, they wanted to know that the variable was both truthy and a boolean. In which case neither of the two code snippets above would be correct.  In that case, you would want to write the code like this:</p>
<p>var trueVariable = true;<br>if (trueVariable === true) {<br>    console.log(‘what a surprise, it is true!’);<br>}</p>
<p>What do we mean by “truthy” or “falsy”? <img src="/uploads/2015/12/image-1.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Truthy-Falsy-Basics"><a href="#Truthy-Falsy-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Truthy/Falsy Basics"></a>Truthy/Falsy Basics</h2><p>JavaScript treats any of the following values as “falsy”.</p>
<ul>
<li>null</li>
<li>undefined</li>
<li>0</li>
<li>NaN (Not a Number.  The value, not the type)</li>
<li>an empty length string (‘’, or “”)</li>
<li>false</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else is truthy. Here are some code snippets that demonstrate the rules.</p>
<p>if (noneExistantVariable) {<br>    // this console.log should not run<br>    console.log(“noneExistantVariable”);<br>}</p>
<p>var aNullVariable = null;<br>if (aNullVariable) {<br>    // this console.log should not run<br>    console.log(‘aNullVariable’);<br>}</p>
<p>var anEmptyString = ‘’;<br>if (anEmptyString) {<br>    // this console.log should not run<br>    console.log(‘anEmptyString’);<br>}</p>
<p>var aStringWithZeroInIt = ‘0’;<br>if (aStringWithZeroInIt) {<br>    // this console.log should run<br>    console.log(‘aStringWithZeroInIt’);<br>}</p>
<p>var aNumberWithZero = 0;<br>if (aNumberWithZero) {<br>    // this console.log should not run<br>    console.log(‘aNumberWithZero’)<br>}</p>
<p>var aNumberOtherThanZero = 2;<br>if (aNumberOtherThanZero) {<br>    // this console.log should run<br>    console.log(‘aNumberOtherThanZero’);<br>}</p>
<p>var aNoneNumericStringConvertedToANumber = Number(‘abc’);<br>if (aNoneNumericStringConvertedToANumber) {<br>    // this console.log should not run<br>    console.log(‘aNoneNumericStringConvertedToANumber’);<br>}</p>
<p>Mostly, writing our code like this adds a bit of convenience.  And yet, these shortcuts can also introduce unintended side effects.</p>
<h2 id="Truthy-Falsy-Dangers"><a href="#Truthy-Falsy-Dangers" class="headerlink" title="Truthy/Falsy Dangers"></a>Truthy/Falsy Dangers</h2><p>For example, I recently ran into some code that looks like this:</p>
<p>if (!obj.min) {<br>    obj.min = ‘NA’;<br>}</p>
<p>The intention of this code is that if min was null, or had not been defined on the object, we would set the property to ‘NA’.  But what if min is defined as 0?  In that case, we want to leave min as it is.  But this code will reset the value to ‘NA’ which is not at all what we wanted. There are several ways you might fix this code depending on what the surrounding code might look like. You might add a check to see if obj.min is numeric, but what if it accidentally got set to a string?  You might try converting obj.min to a number and then testing the type.  Remember, a string that isn’t numeric converts to NaN. In this case, I think the best solution is to test for exactly what we intended.  Is it not null and not undefined?</p>
<p>var obj = { min: 0 }<br>if (obj.min === null ||<br>    typeof obj.min === ‘undefined’) {<br>    obj.min = ‘NA’;<br>}</p>
<p>In fact, I use this code so much that I have created a utility class that has this as a function.</p>
<p>function isNullOrUndefined(v) {<br>    if (v === null ||<br>        typeof v === ‘undefined’) {<br>        return true;<br>    }<br>    return false;<br>}</p>
<h2 id="What-About"><a href="#What-About" class="headerlink" title="What About !"></a>What About !</h2><p>One final place you may get confused working with truthy and falsy is using the not operator, !. Just one quick simple example.  What if we take one of our first examples and place a ! in front of the variable we are testing?</p>
<p>if (!noneExistantVariable) {</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Is this truthy or falsy? You may be inclined to think that this is still falsy because the noneExistantVariable is still undefined and putting a ! in front of it will not change the fact.  But, what you may not realize is that the ! converts the expression to a boolean and the expression !noneExistantVariable is not just truthy, but is in fact the boolean value true.</p>

        <p>Way back before I was doing any programming, I was working at Radio Shack in the Chicago area.  Radio Shack, the company everyone loves to hate.  Regardless of what your experience may have been, back in the day, in the Chicago area, it was a pretty good company to work for.  We were encouraged to take stuff home and learn how it worked.  Anything in the store was open to this option.  The goal was that when a customer came into the store, one of us would know enough about the product that we could answer questions confidently. The other thing they provided that was pretty nice was an employee stock purchase program that vested at the end of each year.  This was a no brainer because they matched up to 3% of your salary.  You contribute 3%, they match 100% of the contribution.  It was like giving yourself a raise.  Because even if the stock went down, we could count on the stock going up again. That was the beginning of my love affair with investing and figuring out the stock market. During the run-up to the dotCom crash, I was making quite a bit more than we spent and that all got socked away into stocks.  During those days, it was hard to NOT make money.  So, I did pretty well, as did anyone else who didn’t spend all they made.  This was good, because I spent most of the year after the crash living off those savings! For the next several years after that, I continued to invest.  The problem is, it took a lot of time away from my keeping up with technology, and the best I could do was maintain my account balance.  Finally, with influences from books such as <a href="/the4HourWorkWeek">The 4 Hour Work Week</a> and some other Internet marketing gurus I was following at the time, I decided to start out sourcing my life.  What better place to start than my investing?  So, I interviewed several different financial advisors and ended up giving my money to one of them to invest for me. Recently, I’ve been learning more about investing and I’ve discovered some rather disturbing facts: <img src="/uploads/2015/12/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Mutual-Funds-Have-Hidden-Fees"><a href="#Mutual-Funds-Have-Hidden-Fees" class="headerlink" title="Mutual Funds Have Hidden Fees"></a>Mutual Funds Have Hidden Fees</h2><p>While not the first time I’ve heard of this, I started listening to an audio version of <a href="/moneyMasterOfTheGame">Money, Master of the Game</a> recently where this fact was brought back into focus.  This hidden fee fact has been documented all over the Internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703382904575059690954870722">The Hidden Cost Of Mutual Funds (WSJ)</a></li>
<li><a href="//www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/08/hidden-investment-fees.asp">The Hidden Cost Of Mutual Funds (Investopia)</a></li>
<li><a href="//money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/2015/03/04/the-mutual-fund-fees-we-dont-talk-about">The Mutual Fund Fees We Don’t Talk About (US News)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested to see how much you are losing by investing in mutual funds, you can use one of these calculators:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//www.marketriders.com/mutualfund-fee-calculator">Market Riders Mutual Fund Calculator</a></li>
<li><a href="//apps.finra.org/fundanalyzer/1/fa.aspx">FINRA Fund Calculator</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are others, but I’m sure you can use the search engines just like I can.  What is interesting is what the power of compounding interest, does to your returns.  Remember, you aren’t getting this fee money you should be getting year over year.  It’s like a leak in your wallet that keeps growing.</p>
<h2 id="The-Rate-of-Return-Isn’t-the-Rate-You-Will-Experience"><a href="#The-Rate-of-Return-Isn’t-the-Rate-You-Will-Experience" class="headerlink" title="The Rate of Return Isn’t the Rate You Will Experience"></a>The Rate of Return Isn’t the Rate You Will Experience</h2><p>If you’ve already plugged in some of your real numbers into those calculators using your own mutual funds, you already realize that you are hemorrhaging money by using a mutual fund.  And this says nothing of the trading fees involved in buying/selling the fund and any fees you are paying your financial advisor.  Oh, and check this out.  I found out recently that if I close my account, they’ll charge me for that too!  What?! But, it gets even worse.  You see, the way these funds report returns ends up being rather questionable as well. First, the returns they report are before any of the fees.  It is how much they made with the money.  Not how much you’ll make. Second, and I think most of us get this but it still needs to be stated, the stated returns are year over year based on one investment at the beginning of the time period.  If you only invest when things are going well, you’ll see returns that are worse.  If you invest only when the market is doing poorly, you’ll get better returns.  Now, if we could only figure out how to time things so that we only invest when the market is about to go up! So, what good are the rate of return numbers in the marketing material?  Since rate of return is regulated, the best way to use these numbers is for initial comparison purposes.  Or not, because…</p>
<h2 id="Over-Time-Hardly-Anyone-Beats-the-Market"><a href="#Over-Time-Hardly-Anyone-Beats-the-Market" class="headerlink" title="Over Time Hardly Anyone Beats the Market"></a>Over Time Hardly Anyone Beats the Market</h2><p>There are a few super stars out there.  But unless you have a lot of money already, you can’t afford them.  Most of these funds are closed now anyhow. And figuring out who will end up being the next Ray Dalio is practically impossible.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="My-Consulting-Gig-Made-Me-Do-It"><a href="#My-Consulting-Gig-Made-Me-Do-It" class="headerlink" title="My Consulting Gig Made Me Do It"></a>My Consulting Gig Made Me Do It</h2><p>Around the same time that I was (re)learning all of this, I got a new gig at a financial management company that is regulated by various security and exchange related regulations.  They forgot to tell me before I started about all the “Compliance” laws that would be imposed on me.  If I had known, I probably wouldn’t have bothered with taking on this contract.  At least not in the present form. But, I’m here now. One of the things they wanted me to do was to get permission before trading certain securities.  The problem is, if you remember from the beginning of this article, I don’t do my own trading.  So this means that I would have to have my financial advisor clear every trade he makes with me.  Oh.  And he’d have to make the trade within 24 hours of the approval.  Even my advisor was afraid of messing this up. And, if I end up staying longer than 6 months, they want me to have all of my accounts in one of about 10 approved trading accounts so they can get the electronic feed. I really don’t like the idea of being spied on.  And why can’t we make laws where the punishment is so severe for doing something wrong that we no longer need laws that prevent something wrong from happening?! But, there is a way out.  If I put my money in a “discretionary” account, then all of these requirements go away. So, I started talking to my advisor about getting a letter stating I had no discretion over the trading in my accounts.  Seems like that would be a simple thing to do.  Right?</p>
<h2 id="My-Advisor-Can-Only-Invest-According-To-His-Company’s-Rules"><a href="#My-Advisor-Can-Only-Invest-According-To-His-Company’s-Rules" class="headerlink" title="My Advisor Can Only Invest According To His Company’s Rules"></a>My Advisor Can Only Invest According To His Company’s Rules</h2><p>Only, he couldn’t put two of my accounts into any kind of discretionary account because they didn’t have enough money and the other accounts could only be moved if we combined some of them. It was then that I realized, I could probably do better somewhere else.  Between all of the above and the fact that I had recently been introduced to <a href="/wealthFront">WealthFront</a>, I realized it was time to make a change.</p>
<h2 id="There-are-Better-Options"><a href="#There-are-Better-Options" class="headerlink" title="There are Better Options"></a>There are Better Options</h2><p>You see, there is a kind of investment that you can make that consistently keeps pace with the market and has a very small fee factor.  These are index funds.  In particular, Vanguard index funds.  My advisor claimed he couldn’t trade these unless I was in a certain type of account he had available.  But, you can see if you go to Vanguard, the entry for one of their index funds is VERY small. So, I could do better if I just go a regular trading account and traded on my own.  But, to do it right, you need to do portfolio allocation, portfolio rebalancing, and if you are using an account that isn’t a retirement account, you’ll probably want to do some tax loss harvesting.  Tax loss harvesting is a way of making it look like you have a loss but keeping your money invested.  It is supposed to increase your returns. Oh, and there is that whole spying thing.  So, rather than doing it myself again, I opted to move my money to <a href="/wealthFront">WealthFront</a>.  The management fees for WealthFront are just 1.25% and the first $10K is free, as in, no management fee.  But, if you sign up using my link, you can get the first $15K free.  I also get an additional $5K managed for free.  So, you can help yourself AND help me. I just got my money transferred recently and the market hasn’t been doing so well in general.  What I can tell you is the account is doing as well as the market.  I can’t really comment on returns.  But, what I can comment on is the level of service.  I’ve sent support A LOT of questions.  They’ve always been answered within a day.  They created a custom letter to make my compliance office happy with the accounts.  They’ve helped me with the move of the accounts.  They’ve clarified fee questions.  NO FEE FOR CLOSING!  No fee for opening.  No fee for any trades.  Just 1.25% of my account less the amount that is currently free. How do they pull this off?  Why are they so inexpensive when everyone else is charging so much?  They’ve automated the whole thing. Love it. Check them out.  <a href="/wealthFront">WealthFront</a></p>

        <p>I’ve written before about how your beliefs impact your behavior as a programmer in several previous articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/limiting-beliefs-of-programmers/">Limiting Beliefs of Programmers</a></li>
<li><a href="/how-to-excel-as-a-programmer-or-anything-else/">How To Excel as a Programmer</a></li>
<li><a href="/the-fallacy-of-motion/">The Fallacy of Motion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, many of my post that don’t address a programming skills directly, tend to deal with why we do what we do (or not) as programmers. But one question I’ve never asked is this, “If what we believe drives what we do, what drives what we believe?” As it turns out, this is an even more important question than, “what do you believe?” because it also makes you ask follow-up questions that may make you uncomfortable. <img src="/uploads/2015/12/image.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Self-Help-Gets-a-Bad-Reputation"><a href="#Self-Help-Gets-a-Bad-Reputation" class="headerlink" title="Self-Help Gets a Bad Reputation"></a>Self-Help Gets a Bad Reputation</h2><p>I have, for most of my adult life, looked down on “self-help” books as largely a Godless attempt at solving problems only God can solve.  At the very least, they are solving problems I’ve been taught that God is supposed to solve. But, as I’ve matured I’ve come to realize that I may have been mistaken. Maybe you have looked down at this genre of books too for the same, or different reasons. Of course, most of the self-help surface material does damage to otherwise legitimately helpful information. For example, maybe you’ve heard the “Law of Attraction” explained something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to be rich, just start visualizing being rich and riches will start flowing to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And anyone with half a brain is going to look at that statement and think, “Are you kidding me?!” But, when you really start trying to understand what these people might be trying to convey, you realize it is really more like what I would call the “Green Civic” phenomenon.</p>
<h2 id="Green-Civic-Phenomenon"><a href="#Green-Civic-Phenomenon" class="headerlink" title="Green Civic Phenomenon"></a>Green Civic Phenomenon</h2><p>What is the “Green Civic Phenomenon?” I’m so glad you asked. The last car I purchased (1994 if anyone is interested) was a Green Civic.  Prior to purchasing my car, I didn’t notice any Civics on the road at all.  But, the day after I got my new car, Civics were all over the place.  And Green Civics were even more noticeable. Did everyone purchase new Civics on the same day?  Of course not. What happened then? Well, simply the fact of my purchasing the car told my brain that Civics were important and I started noticing what was already there.  In self-help speak, I was “attracting” Green Civics. And that’s just one place where I’ve been wrong.</p>
<h2 id="Can-N-People-Be-Wrong"><a href="#Can-N-People-Be-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="Can N People Be Wrong"></a>Can N People Be Wrong</h2><p>Well, yes.  Yes they can. But… I have learned, over time, that if a book is REALLY popular or a guru is really popular, he’s probably just saying what people want to hear.  So, I’ve avoided reading some really popular, and probably really helpful, books simply because I want the truth, not simply something that feels good.  So, you can excuse me if I’ve avoid a book that I should have read a really long time ago. But, a couple of things happened recently that got me to take another look at a particular guru that I have been avoiding. The first is that <a href="//simpleprogrammer.com/">John Sonmez</a> recommended one of his books, “<a href="/moneyMasterOfTheGame">Money Master of the Game</a>.”  Since money is something I’m interested in, I got the audio version of the book and started listening.  I may speak more about that particular book at some other point in time.  But, while I was listening to that book, I heard him talk about things I’ve already mentioned to you in previous blog post.  That what we do is controlled by what we believe.  I can’t remember exactly what he said, but there was enough there that my brain said, “Maybe this guy isn’t quite the wacko you’ve thought he was.” I also started hearing his name and work show up on several podcast I listen to.  All favorable. OK, OK.  I should at least see what he has to say!</p>
<h2 id="The-Book-I-Thought-I-Would-Never-Read"><a href="#The-Book-I-Thought-I-Would-Never-Read" class="headerlink" title="The Book I Thought I Would Never Read"></a>The Book I Thought I Would Never Read</h2><p>And so, I picked up a copy of “<a href="/awakenTheGiant">Awaken the Giant Within</a>.”  I’m a bit past half way and the first half of the book confirmed a lot of what I’ve been teaching others, and speculating on my own behalf, about how behaviors are formed.  How to use some thought tweaks to get yourself to quickly change your behavior.  But it is the second half that has started to move me into a new level of thinking.  Not only does what you believe impact what you do, but what you believe is controlled by what you value.  And, if your values aren’t in line with each other, you will find yourself conflicted about what you want to do. This has, obviously, got me thinking about what I value.  Why I value it.  And, do I want to continue valuing it?  It certainly explains areas in my life that I struggle with, both professionally and personally. Like,</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is TDD still a struggle for me, even though I strongly believe in the practice?</li>
<li>Why was it so hard to quit good activities that I’m done with?</li>
</ul>
<p>I had been thinking about this stuff prior to reading the book.  But this is how the “Law of Attraction” really works.  Because I was already thinking in this way, I was primed to notice and be receptive to this information.  Just like my Green Civic.</p>

        <p>NUnit 3 recently released and if you’ve picked it up you’ve probably already found that there are several changes between version 3 and version 2. If you haven’t, here are some highlights: <img src="/uploads/2015/11/image3.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Parallel-Tests"><a href="#Parallel-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Parallel Tests"></a>Parallel Tests</h2><p>This is probably the most anticipated change.  We can finally run multiple tests at the same time. In NUnit 3.0, we finally have the ability to run multiple tests at the same time by using the <code>Parallelizable</code> Attribute in combination with the <code>LevelOfParallelism</code> attribute. By default, all of our tests run sequentially.  But if you’ve written your tests correctly, you should be able to run them all at the same time.  To enable this feature, you’ll need to first specify how many tests you can run at the same time by adding the <code>LevelOfParallelism</code> attribute to your assembly. In your <code>properties/AssemblyInfo.cs</code> file add the following code:</p>
<p>[assembly: LevelOfParallelism(8)]</p>
<p>To make a test run at the same time as other tests, add the <code>Parallelizable</code> attribute to either the namespace, or class.  As of NUnit 3.0, running tests within a fixture in parallel is not yet supported. The Parallelizable attribute takes one optional parameter named <code>ParallelScope</code>.  This option allows you to specify what level of code can run in parallel.</p>
<ul>
<li>None: No tests can run in parallel</li>
<li>Self: This level can run in parallel with other similar levels</li>
<li>Children: Test under this level can run in parallel.</li>
<li>Fixtures: Only fixtures under this level can run in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attributes applied to nested namespaces or classes override attributes applied to namespaces they are within.</p>
<h2 id="Test-Runner"><a href="#Test-Runner" class="headerlink" title="Test Runner"></a>Test Runner</h2><p>Another big change is the test runner.  By default, the test runner is just a regular console app.  I don’t know about you, but I miss the tree view.  But it is what it is. I would suggest that you invest in ReSharper just to get the test runner that it has.  If you can’t do that, use the MS Test Adapter from NUnit.org to run your tests in Visual Studio using the MS Test Runner.</p>
<h2 id="ExpectedException-Attribute"><a href="#ExpectedException-Attribute" class="headerlink" title="ExpectedException Attribute"></a>ExpectedException Attribute</h2><p>In NUnit 2, we had the option of using the <code>ExpectedException</code> attribute on a test that was supposed to throw an exception or we could use the <code>Assert.That</code> syntax that we’ve already documented.  In NUnit 3, <code>ExpectedException</code> is no longer available.</p>
<h2 id="TestFixtureSetUp-TestFixtureTearDown"><a href="#TestFixtureSetUp-TestFixtureTearDown" class="headerlink" title="TestFixtureSetUp/TestFixtureTearDown"></a>TestFixtureSetUp/TestFixtureTearDown</h2><p>In NUnit 2, when we wanted to have a method that only ran once for a test class as part of setup or teardown, we would use these two attributes.  We would also use these in combination with the <code>SetupFixture</code> attribute to run methods once at the namespace level. In NUnit 3, these have been replaced with <code>OneTimeSetUp</code> and <code>OneTimeTearDown</code> in both cases. While <code>TestFixtureSetup</code> and <code>TestFixtureTearDown</code> will continue to work as part of a <code>TestFixture</code>, you should move to the new attributes as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="TestCaseSource"><a href="#TestCaseSource" class="headerlink" title="TestCaseSource"></a>TestCaseSource</h2><p>If you specify the property to use for your tests data using a string, that property now HAS to be static.</p>
<h2 id="ValueSource"><a href="#ValueSource" class="headerlink" title="ValueSource"></a>ValueSource</h2><p>Similarly, this now only uses a static property when specified as a string.</p>
<h2 id="Asserts"><a href="#Asserts" class="headerlink" title="Asserts"></a>Asserts</h2><p>Several assert syntaxes have changed.  Once again, check the documentation. For a full list of <a href="//github.com/nunit/nunit/wiki/Breaking-Changes">breaking changes</a>, check out the <a href="//github.com/nunit/nunit/wiki">NUnit 3 documentation</a>. What significant changes have you noticed? Let me know in the comments.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Every week when I write, I try to think back on the past week and think, “What have I learned that might be useful to others.”  Most weeks that is a pretty easy question to answer because I get most of my pleasure from learning new stuff.  But this week was different. When I sat down to write today, I couldn’t come up with a subject that couldn’t be covered with a sentence.  More of a tweet than a blog post.  It was so bad that I decided to go run the errands that are on my list and come back to it once I got home. Evidently, that was a good move because I think I have something that will be genuinely useful.  Although I will admit that if you’ve been working with Angular for very long at all, you may have already learned what I’m about to explain. <img src="/uploads/2015/11/image2.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h2><p>To make sure we are all on the same page, I want to cover the basics first.  Every controller has a $scope variable associated with it.  $scopes can be nested within each other, which allows us to either have child scopes add information to parent scopes using prototypical inheritance, or the child $scope can be isolated so that it can’t see the parent $scope up the nesting chain.  In either case, you can gain access to the parent $scope by using the $parent variable. What is important to realize about $scope is that it is attached to the element’s this pointer.  Every controller you create is its own object and $scope is just one of many properties that is part of that object. Now, in normal Angular programming, you may only ever create one controller per element.  But if you’ve ever created a directive that gets used on multiple places, or you’ve done anything with repeaters, you know that controllers can be created “under the hood.”  So that the $scope for the repeater item isn’t the same as the $scope for the element that holds the main collection.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-ControllerAs"><a href="#scope-and-ControllerAs" class="headerlink" title="$scope and ControllerAs"></a>$scope and ControllerAs</h2><p>In version 1.2 of Angular, the ControllerAs syntax was added, this can be added in a number of different ways that I won’t describe here.  That’s old news and there are plenty of places to find that information, including the Angular documentation.  But what isn’t clear at first, is what this feature does for us under the hood. Many people, who haven’t dug in deep under the hood assume that somehow this replaces $scope.  But in fact what it does is that it adds a variable onto $scope.  If you were to use ControllerAs redMonkey, what actually happens under the hood is that you end up with a variable named “redMonkey” that is hanging off of the controller’s $scope variable. In fact, what you end up with is this holding a property “$scope” and $scope holding a property “redMonkey” which is actually pointing to the controller’s this pointer.  Further, it is possible to have elements in your view bind to other variables hanging off of $scope while in the same view, other things are bound to variables hanging off of redMonkeys.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-Singletons"><a href="#scope-and-Singletons" class="headerlink" title="$scope and Singletons"></a>$scope and Singletons</h2><p>I hope at this point you have a relatively clear picture of how $scope works because this is where things start to get interesting.  You see, just about everything else that you create in Angular is a singleton.  That is, only one instance of it exist in the entire application.  So, what happens if you pass $scope into one of these singletons and you use that singleton multiple times on the same page? Well, there’s no telling for sure.  You might get lucky and everything will seem to work, until one day it doesn’t.  In fact, you may never notice that there is a problem if you only ever call it from one controller or directive at a time. But to use singletons effectively, what you need to do is that you will need to pass the scope to each of the functions you need to have use it, unless you can be sure it will only be able to use one scope at a time.  As a general rule, you should never store state in anything that is a singleton. How do I know? Well, this week, I was working on some code that I thought was overriding the control’s controller.  But, when I finally got it all working I found that it only worked some of the time because what I had really overridden was a method in a directive.  Another time this week, I was doing something similar thinking I was overriding a function in the main control’s $scope only to find out that the function I was overloading was in a nested repeater item.</p>
<h2 id="Finding-scope-for-an-element"><a href="#Finding-scope-for-an-element" class="headerlink" title="Finding $scope for an element"></a>Finding $scope for an element</h2><p>If you need help figuring out what $scope is bound to what element in your code, you can use the <a href="//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk?hl=en">Batarang plugin</a>.  You can also use the following JavaScript code using any developer tool you might want to use.</p>
<p>angular.element(elementSelector).scope()</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-Repeaters"><a href="#scope-and-Repeaters" class="headerlink" title="$scope and Repeaters"></a>$scope and Repeaters</h2><p>So, back to one of my issues this week.  What I was working with was a tree control.  The tree was a set of repeaters within repeaters.  The original function that was bound to the click event was bound to the item scope so that each item was bound to its own instance of the onClick method. What I was trying to do was to override the function with a function in a directive I had created that wrapped the tree control and added a search box.  Fortunately, the item template could be changed, but how to get it to call MY click handler instead of the one it called by default? To further complicate matters, the $scope in the directives were isolated so I couldn’t add a new function on the scope I had control over and have the child scope see it. Or could I? The directive I was creating does have access to the scope of the tree control.  So, all I really needed to do was to create a new variable hanging off the tree control’s scope that pointed to the scope I wanted it to see and then in my template I could point to that variable and the function hanging off of it as the thing that should get called on click. Sure enough, that worked.</p>

        <p>When I first wrote down the idea for this post, I was originally thinking about how we might use agile development practices in a work place that practices Water Fall or worse.  But since then, I’ve expanded my thinking to include the concept of using agile everywhere, including where it “isn’t allowed.” Here’s what I’m talking about.  What does your work environment look like?  Many of the places I end up working either are using no formal process at all, or weakly attempt some form of Scrum or Water Fall.  In fact, my current major gig has a “project manager” (I use the term loosely) that manages our project with MS Project.  There is not even a formal issue tracking system.  And this is at a very LARGE organization that SHOULD know better. <img src="/uploads/2015/11/image1.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Agile-in-an-Anti-Agile-Environment"><a href="#Agile-in-an-Anti-Agile-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Agile in an Anti-Agile Environment"></a>Agile in an Anti-Agile Environment</h2><h3 id="Kanban-Board"><a href="#Kanban-Board" class="headerlink" title="Kanban Board"></a>Kanban Board</h3><p>Now, I’m not saying I’m the most organized guy on the planet.  In fact, in an environment like this, it would be easy to just go with the flow.  But I know me well enough to know that if I don’t have a place to keep track of the task I need to accomplish, something will fall through the cracks.  So, I got permission to use <a href="/trello">Trello</a> along with the <a href="/plusForTrello">Plus for Trello</a> plugin on Chrome so that I can at least track the task that have been assigned to me. Trello, for those who don’t know, allows you to setup a basic Kanban board and configure it any way you would like.  From the basic, “To do”, “In Progress”, “Done” format to something more in line with your actual work flow.  For this project, I have “Back Log”, “On Hold”, “Up Next”, “In Progress”, “Done This Week” and “Done”.  Yeah, that’s a lot of columns.  But I want to be able to keep track of where my task are at that level.  The beauty of Trello is that you can configure it however you want. Plus For Trello builds on that and allows you to add estimates to each of your Trello Cards.  While they refer to the estimate as “hours” I just translate that to “Effort Points” and track how much effort I think I’ve completed rather than how many hours I’ve actually worked. Between the two, I can track how far along in the project I am, how many effort points I tend to complete each week, and I’m the only one on the team who can give a reasonable guess as to when I will be done with this project I am working on.  And when I need to change the estimates, I can show when they changed and why.</p>
<h3 id="Productivity-Hacks"><a href="#Productivity-Hacks" class="headerlink" title="Productivity Hacks"></a>Productivity Hacks</h3><p>But agile isn’t just about Kanban boards and accurate estimates.  Agile is about becoming better.  So, what are some ways you can become better at work without being any more disruptive than you have to be?  Here are some ways that have been effective for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use the Pomodoro technique</strong>. The <a href="/pomodoro">Pomodoro</a> technique is a technique that has you highly focused on the task at hand for 25 minutes at a time.  No interruptions for email, social media, coffee.  That’s for the breaks or their own Pomodoro.  After 25 minutes of work, you get a 5 minute break.  Sometimes I just sit in my chair and close my eyes.  Kind of a mini nap.  The routine has you do 4 Pomodoros and then rest for 15 minutes instead of 5.  If you take a lunch, you should take your lunch break during one of the longer Pomodoros.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Distractions</strong> I don’t know about you, but the last time I had the luxury of an office was 2.5 years ago when I was working from home.  I miss those days.  But now I close my virtual door by putting on headphones and listening to <a href="//t.co/EgPhHCQqLE">this Pandora station that I created</a> along with using the <a href="/brainwave">BrainWave</a> iPhone app set to “Problem Solving” for 25 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Batch E-mail</strong> As I said before, don’t check email while you are working.  I check mine during the Pomodoro breaks.  If you get more than what you can handle during the breaks you should create a Pomodoro for them.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule Your Day!</strong> OK, this may or may not work for you depending on your environment.  But, it is worth a try.  Personally, I know that my best hours are in the morning and that I start losing my concentration around 1:30.  I start my day at around 7am.  Ideally, if you want me to be productive, you won’t schedule meetings prior to 1:30.  So, I went into outlook and scheduled myself as “Busy” from 7am to 1:30pm.  Now when someone looks to see when I am available, they will see that I am available from 1:30 to 3:30. You might object that this is not being honest.  But I would argue that it is if you honestly believe that keeping appointments with yourself is as important as keeping appointments with other people.  It is just a matter of perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Turn Off Your Phone</strong>! OK, I’m assuming you are all programmers and not sales people.  But, I would go so far as to say that the only time you should answer your phone is when you have an appointment.  I stopped answering my phone YEARS ago.  Most of the calls that I got were either sales calls or recruiters.  Then I finally got smart and created a silent ring tone for my phone.  That is my default ring tone.  And my default vibrate pattern is no vibration at all.  I don’t even know that my phone rang until I look at my phone and it says I have a missed call. But, I can hear you say, I might miss something important.  Well, yes, there are calls that I don’t want to miss.  For those, I assign real ring tones.  Everyone in my family and some VERY close friends, all get a real ring tone that makes a sound. What about potential clients?  Well, first I schedule the call via email, if I even determine it is necessary, and second I ask for the number they will be calling from so that I can assign a ring tone to that number. I wish I could do something similar with my desk phone at work.  I answered it yesterday only to have it be a sales call.  I should have known better!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Agile-Home"><a href="#Agile-Home" class="headerlink" title="Agile Home"></a>Agile Home</h2><p>There is a whole course on PluralSight about being an <a href="/agileFamilies">Agile Family</a>.  I’m not talking about that.  I’m talking about being personally Agile at home just like I am suggesting that you can be personally Agile at work, regardless of the environment.</p>
<h3 id="Kanban-Again"><a href="#Kanban-Again" class="headerlink" title="Kanban Again"></a>Kanban Again</h3><p>Yep, I use Trello at home too.  But not the Plus for Trello plugin.  At least not yet.  I have a list that keeps track of my exercise rotation.  I have a list for Saturday.  I have a list of chores I need to do.  I have others, but those are the ones that I use regularly.</p>
<h3 id="Schedules"><a href="#Schedules" class="headerlink" title="Schedules"></a>Schedules</h3><p>I schedule my whole day.  This probably sounds more extreme than it is.  I was finding that not having a schedule, especially after work, was actually preventing me from getting stuff done that I really wanted to get done. Here are tips for scheduling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you really want something to get done, schedule it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Don’t schedule every last minute</strong>. For example, I know it generally takes me 45 minutes to get home.  But I also know bad traffic could make that longer.  So I don’t plan the next activity after work until 4:45.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule your Kanban list</strong>. I’m assuming your Kanban list are projects that you want to get done.  Well, if you really want them to get done, when are you going to work on them?</li>
<li><strong>Don’t try to do too much</strong>. Once I started scheduling, I realized I was trying to accomplish way more than was physically possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schedules are a great way for you to determine, ahead of time, what is most important to you.  Once that decision has been made, it is just a matter of execution.  If there are other things you’d like to be able to do, put them on the back log.</p>
<h2 id="The-Point"><a href="#The-Point" class="headerlink" title="The Point"></a>The Point</h2><p>So what’s the point of all of this?  Don’t wait on someone else.  You can be agile even if/when others aren’t. How are you being agile?</p>

        <p>For months now I have been suffering from the dreaded random computer freeze.  It has gotten progressively worse.  Everything I’ve tried to do to fix the problem has failed.  I know what you’re thinking too.  “Must be a virus.”  Yeah, except I have run multiple virus checkers and come up empty.  I read someplace else that maybe it was a driver issue.  OK, but which driver?  Memory?  I guess that is possible, but not likely.  I’ll admit that is one thing I didn’t check. The great thing about this issue is that it has caused me to write better code, because the code I’m currently working on would fail as it was writing to the database, even though the database is on the same computer.  So, now I make it try three times, with 2 minutes in between, before giving up.  Fortunately, it isn’t a routine that NEEDS to be fast.  In fact, it is better if it is not. <img src="/uploads/2015/11/image.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Another-Problem"><a href="#Another-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Another Problem"></a>Another Problem</h2><p>I’ve also noticed, more recently, that the CTRL key on my keyboard doesn’t want to work.  CTRL-C and CTRL-V often result in “c” or “v” being typed out unless I’m really intentional about pressing the keys.  Not the best way to go about programming.  Fortunately, I’m not using this computer to do my regular work (I’m currently working on-site with the client’s computer).  So, for the little bit of usage, I could live with it.  Besides, I’m cheap. Now, when I first got <a href="/backlitKeyboard">this keyboard</a>, I was really impressed.  The backlit keyboard was cool, but what I really liked was the mechanical keys.  So much smoother.  So, I was a little disappointed when I was thinking about replacing it.  And if I did replace it, should I get another of the same kind, or should I get something else? So, I procrastinated.</p>
<h2 id="Enough-Is-Enough"><a href="#Enough-Is-Enough" class="headerlink" title="Enough Is Enough!"></a>Enough Is Enough!</h2><p>Finally, a couple of weeks ago, I got so tired of not being able to copy and paste correctly, that I broke down and went to Amazon to see what is currently available.  This is when the <a href="/logitechWave">Logitech Wave</a> series caught my eye. I’ve always liked the idea of ergonomic keyboards, but when I’ve tried the split keyboard, I just didn’t like them.  Yes, maybe I could get used to one.  But, I don’t want to have to get used to one.  The Logitech Wave is a nice compromise.  It FEELS mostly like a regular keyboard because the keys aren’t split.  But it has a slight curve or wave (hence the name) that conforms to what your fingers want to do instead of making your fingers comply with a straight row of keys.</p>
<h2 id="So-What-Is-It-Like"><a href="#So-What-Is-It-Like" class="headerlink" title="So What Is It Like?"></a>So What Is It Like?</h2><p>So far, I like it enough.  I can’t say if it helps with carpal tunnel because I don’t really suffer from that problem.  It is a keyboard, it wasn’t all that expensive. It is wireless, so I was able to get it setup without crawling under my desk (I did have to crawl under my desk to unplug the old keyboard!).  Honestly, the only issue I’ve had was during the setup.  I unpacked the keyboard and the mouse (it comes with a wireless mouse) and realized, I didn’t know where the receiver part was that plugs into a USB port.  I looked back in the box for it, was it in one of the bags I hadn’t opened yet?  No.  Hmm.  Where could it be? Oh, there it is.  Stuck in the cardboard.  Seriously, this thing is SO small, if you don’t pay attention, you could lose it.  And I almost did before I had ever even gotten it installed!</p>
<h2 id="What’s-This-Got-To-Do-With-Computer-Freezes"><a href="#What’s-This-Got-To-Do-With-Computer-Freezes" class="headerlink" title="What’s This Got To Do With Computer Freezes?"></a>What’s This Got To Do With Computer Freezes?</h2><p>Over the rest of the day, I noticed, my computer isn’t freezing any more.  Maybe I’m just imagining things. But, I’ve been using this, as of this writing, for over a week.  I’ve used it for at least 2 hours every night.  I’m using it now to write this post.  I wrote last week’s post.  Seriously, my computer no longer freezes.  Whoda thunk?</p>
