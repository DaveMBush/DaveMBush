        <p>In my job as a JavaScript architect, trainer and mentor, I’m often asked, “What’s your favorite framework?”  Or “What is the best framework?” And it surprises people when I give them two answers to that question. Right now, of the frameworks I’ve looked at, my favorite framework is <a href="blog.dmbcllc.com/tag/react-js/">React JS</a>.  But if I were picking a corporate framework, at this point I’d probably land on <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/angular-2-first-impressions-compared-to-angular-1/">Angular 2.0</a>. But the question you are probably asking is , “Why two different selections?”  And, I think a more interesting question would be, “How did you select which one to use?” In fact, when I was thinking about writing this post, I was going to title it “How to Choose a JavaScript Framework” but as I considered what I would actually say, I realized that the factors I would use really apply to any language and any time. But an even more interesting question is this.  What factors are essential when picking out a framework.  If I ignored these questions, what are the cost? So, I give you… [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/image-3.png" alt="How Not to Choose a Framework" title="How Not to Choose a Framework"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/diversey/980101167/">Tony Webster</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">Visual hunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="How-Not-to-Choose-a-Framework"><a href="#How-Not-to-Choose-a-Framework" class="headerlink" title="How Not to Choose a Framework"></a>How Not to Choose a Framework</h2><p>As we progress, I’ll mention frameworks I have experience with.  To be fair, I will let you know my preferences. In order, the frameworks I would prefer to use would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>React JS</li>
<li>Angular 2</li>
<li>Angular 1</li>
<li>Ext JS 5 or 6</li>
<li>Ext JS 4</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were going to recommend a framework for a large enterprise organization, the order would be slightly different:</p>
<ul>
<li>Angular 2</li>
<li>Angular 1</li>
<li>Ext JS 5 or 6</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>Ext JS 4</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, here’s what you should pay attention to.</p>
<h2 id="Who-Will-Use-The-Framework"><a href="#Who-Will-Use-The-Framework" class="headerlink" title="Who Will Use The Framework?"></a>Who Will Use The Framework?</h2><p>At the organization I am working at now, most of the people there are Java programmers.  This means that programming in JavaScript, of any flavor, is going to be as much as a mind-shift as moving from C to C++ or C++ to Java or C#.  Yes, there are similarities to what they are used to, but there are enough differences to consider that you’ll probably gravitate toward a framework that allows them to not have to worry about those differences.  On this point Ext or Angular 2 are probably going to rise to the surface because they, more than any other framework, allow you to work with JavaScript more like it was like Java or C# than any other framework I know about.</p>
<h2 id="How-Steep-is-The-Learning-Curve"><a href="#How-Steep-is-The-Learning-Curve" class="headerlink" title="How Steep is The Learning Curve?"></a>How Steep is The Learning Curve?</h2><p>Related to who will use the framework is how long will it take them to learn the framework?  For this, you are going to want to look at things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I buy support so I can get my questions answered?</li>
<li>How clear is the documentation?</li>
<li>How popular is the framework?</li>
<li>Do I already have an expert on my team?</li>
<li>Is there a public Slack channel for this framework?</li>
<li>Do the people behind the framework care about the Enterprise?</li>
</ul>
<p>On this point, depending on the experience of your developers, Ext JS and Angular 2 are probably going to surface as the clear winners while React is going to end up at the very bottom.  As much as I love it personally, I have to admit that learning it has taken me the most amount of time.</p>
<h2 id="How-Opinionated-is-the-Framework"><a href="#How-Opinionated-is-the-Framework" class="headerlink" title="How Opinionated is the Framework?"></a>How Opinionated is the Framework?</h2><p>I remember when VB 1.0 was first introduced.  The reason everyone gave me for why I should love this new development environment was, “Look how fast I can get something up and running.” Well, yes, but… VB let you write code any way that got the job done.  And coming from C++ and MFC and prior to that, OWL from Borland, I recognized that even though you could still write crappy code using a framework that provided some structure, the amount of crappy code you wrote was inversely proportional to the amount of structure the framework provides. When you are working with a large team of developers, something needs to be in place to ensure they are writing code in a highly structured way rather than just getting the job done. Once again, this places Angular 2 at the top of the pile of the ones I’ve actually worked with.  Ext sinks to the bottom of the pile.  While Ext does implement something they call MVC and MVVM, they don’t protect the developer from coding outside of what those design patterns are supposed to look like.  In the case of MVC, I’m not even sure the people who wrote it know what MVC is.</p>
<h2 id="Industry-Standards"><a href="#Industry-Standards" class="headerlink" title="Industry Standards"></a>Industry Standards</h2><p>The easiest way for me to illustrate what I mean here is to point out a few ways this gets violated with the existing frameworks. In order to make Ext work more like a desktop development environment, they generate the HTML for you and use their own layout mechanism to control where the various elements appear on the screen.  Every other framework I’ve mentioned lets you control the layout using CSS.  The advantage to Ext is that I don’t have to know HTML or CSS in order to get a screen up that looks nice.  The down side is that if I want to do anything just a bit out of the Ext box, I quickly become frustrated.  It also takes more time to render a screen than if I were using HTML and CSS.  This is particularly true if your components are nested more than 3 deep. Further, Ext has enabled JavaScript to look more like Java and C# than JavaScript by implementing a proprietary mechanism for defining a class.  What continually worries me is how well this will continue to work as the ECMAScript standards evolve and provide there own mechanisms for achieving the same results. Ext also (sorry, but Ext is the primary violator of this point) uses its own proprietary build process.  It is possible to circumvent their build process for most things.  But the question one has to ask is, “why can’t you just use standards like gulp, grunt or npm scripts?” Even though Angular 2 primarily uses TypeScript, the difference between Angular 2 and Ext is that 1) you don’t HAVE to use TypeScript even though it is highly encourages and 2) TypeScript only implements features that look like they are going to eventually end up in the ECMAScript standards.  So, it is a lot more future proof while adding a lot of the same features that Ext implements in a more proprietary fashion. Another framework where this kind of shows up is with React JS.  While everything about building the app is built using industry standards, the unit testing framework doesn’t allow you to use Karma as your test running.  There is another more proprietary implentation called Jest.  However, I also don’t have to use PhantomJS to gets my components.  I wish I could have both.</p>
<h2 id="How-Testable-Is-It"><a href="#How-Testable-Is-It" class="headerlink" title="How Testable Is It?"></a>How Testable Is It?</h2><p>Anyone who is familiar with my history of post, who who know me personally, know <a href="blog.dmbcllc.com/tag/tdd">I am a huge proponent of TDD</a>.  So, any framework I use has to allow me to unit test.  This is why Ext JS 4 ends up dead last on my list.  You would think that a framework that says they implement MVC would allow you to test the controller without have the view attached.  That’s one of the points of MVC.  But Ext doesn’t allow this. On the other end of the spectrum, React is testable all of the way down.  This is why I love it.  The only reason I don’t consider it the right choice for the enterprise is because it takes so long to learn and the documentation isn’t very well done.</p>
<h2 id="Doing-The-Research"><a href="#Doing-The-Research" class="headerlink" title="Doing The Research"></a>Doing The Research</h2><p>OK.  So, this is what you should look for, but when you are looking at the frameworks, how would you know?  Most of this information is only stuff you would find out after your programmers started using the framework. One way you can find out is to find people who have used the various frameworks you have under consideration.  One of my first test would be, “How much information can I find on the Internet about this framework?”My second question would be, “How popular is this framework?” and then finally I would look for people who don’t like the framework and try to determine if their points are valid.</p>
<h2 id="How-Not-to-Pick-a-Framework"><a href="#How-Not-to-Pick-a-Framework" class="headerlink" title="How Not to Pick a Framework"></a>How Not to Pick a Framework</h2><p>If you want to pick the wrong framework, trust the sales literature.  Don’t ask any question.  Ignore the points above. Ultimately regret your decision.</p>

        <p>I’ve written about <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/category/tdd/">Test Driven Development</a> before.  I’ve even written about <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/100-code-coverage/">100% code coverage</a> before.  And I haven’t written much about it recently because I’ve been focused on JavaScript.  But, I’ve been thinking about the 100% code coverage debate more and I have a few more thoughts on the subject. You see, the more I practice Test Driven Development, the more inclined I am to believe that there are only three reasons for arguing against 100% code coverage. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/image-2.png" alt="100% Code Coverage" title="100% Code Coverage"> </p>
<h2 id="There-is-Something-Wrong-with-Your-Framework"><a href="#There-is-Something-Wrong-with-Your-Framework" class="headerlink" title="There is Something Wrong with Your Framework"></a>There is Something Wrong with Your Framework</h2><p>This will be the easiest one for most people to accept.  It isn’t so personal. You see, I’ve been learning <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/tag/react-js/">React JS</a> and, as I’ve mentioned before, I decided to learn React AND learn to test it at the same time.  The thing that has impressed me from the outset is that ALL of the code that I write is testable.  Where a lot of other frameworks are testable except for the View, React JS is ALL testable. And this got me to thinking, if all of the code you write is testable, why wouldn’t you write tests?  In fact, as I wrote in “<a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/test-driven-learning-an-experiment/">Test Driven Learning, an Experiment</a>”, the process of writing the tests as I go has helped me understand React JS better than if I had not. But compare this to other frameworks where the View is basically HTML.  There is no really easy way to write tests for HTML.  At least, none that I know about. And then there are frameworks that seem to do all they can to make it hard to test.  When I was using Ext JS 4.x, I spent two years looking for a way to make my code testable without having to have the View rendered because the way they had implemented “MVC” made loading the view mandatory.  Talk about tight coupling!  Fortunately, now that they’ve implemented MVVM, if you do this correctly, it solves these problems. Another place where I found testing difficult was with Angular 1.  Most of Angular 1 is quite testable.  It was created with testing in mind.  But as I was trying to add a <a href="//docs.angularjs.org/guide/decorators">decorator</a> to the <a href="//ui-grid.info/">UI Grid</a> component, I found that testing the decorator was quite difficult.  This, I believe, said more about how the UI Grid component had been created than about how the Angular framework was put together.  But this just illustrates my point.  Sometimes, the reason you can’t test has more to do with the tools you are using than any other reason. Then again, the problem may be you.</p>
<h2 id="There-is-Something-Wrong-with-Your-Code"><a href="#There-is-Something-Wrong-with-Your-Code" class="headerlink" title="There is Something Wrong with Your Code"></a>There is Something Wrong with Your Code</h2><p>Now, arguably, in my last example, the reason I was not able to test the decorator for my Grid was because I was missing some fundamental concept related to testing decorators in general or how that related to the Grid. The reason I say this is because the one thing I’ve noticed the more I test is this.  The more I practice TDD, the easier TDD becomes. As I introduce testing into the organizations I work with and as I’ve grown in my own TDD skills, the one thing I’ve noticed is that when we start out learning TDD, it almost always starts out as DDT.  That is, Development Driven Testing. This is, of course, better than not testing at all, but if you wait until after you’ve written your code, or you develop your code without thinking about how you will test it, you will almost always end up in a situation where you will have to rearrange your code to make it testable.  Untestable code is probably the single biggest reason why code doesn’t get tested. If you were able to make yourself write your tests first, you would be much more likely to write test for everything you wrote. This doesn’t help you though if you’ve been tasked with writing tests for all pre-existing code.  Yours on someone else’s.  In this case, the best help I can give you is to recommend the book “<a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/qayn">Working Effectively With Legacy Code</a>” where Michael Feathers illustrates how to handle a lot of the common scenarios he has run into with various languages and how to untangle the mess so that it can be tested.  I will admit it is a tedious read, but there really is no better resource on the topic.</p>
<h2 id="Lack-of-Experience"><a href="#Lack-of-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Experience"></a>Lack of Experience</h2><p>The final reason you might want to think that 100% code coverage is impossible is that you simply don’t have enough experience. As I mentioned above, my own experience has been that the more I practice TDD, the easier it gets.  When I started out, I struggled to write test at all.  Then I got to a point where I would at least attempt to write tests after I’d written some code.  I’m now at the point where I’m writing tests as I code.  Soon, I hope to achieve the ultimate goal of writing test prior to writing the real code.  But even though I wasn’t writing the tests first, I can still say that the tests were driving my development because I knew at some point, I was going to have to test the code with unit tests. But as I’ve monitored the noise on the Internet about using TDD or not.  As people have discussed how much of their code should be tested.  I wonder, “Just how long has this person been trying to tests?”  Along with that, I wonder, “Do they even want to test?”  My dad used to say, “It is amazing how much I don’t understand when it doesn’t fit my plan.” Let’s face it, for most programmers, writing tests is not nearly as much fun as writing the application.  If this is true, then aren’t you already biased against writing tests for your application?  Wouldn’t you much rather write the app and toss it over the fence for someone else to tests?  I know I would. Now combine that with the fact that testing is hard, and you have a recipe for excusing yourself from testing as much of your code as possible. But, if you stick with it.  If you make writing bug free code a personal challenge, you will find that the rewards are worth it. What would it be like to be THE developer who was always working on new features because no one could find bugs in the features you programmed in the past?  What would that do for your career?</p>
<h2 id="The-100-Code-Coverage-Payoff"><a href="#The-100-Code-Coverage-Payoff" class="headerlink" title="The 100% Code Coverage Payoff"></a>The 100% Code Coverage Payoff</h2><p>I want to conclude with another story that illustrates how writing tests paid off. I’ve been working on a resource scheduling component for the last several weeks.  The bulk of the logic is that if two resources are scheduled for the same time, I need to be able to display that there is a conflict.  It sounds pretty straight forward until you look at all the various ways items can overlap.  I’ve isolated the logic for this into a class that is quite testable and I had created a test suite with about 400 tests when I was told that along with that requirement, there were a particular set of conditions where what looked like a conflict wasn’t really a conflict.  I needed to show that there was an overlap, but I need to display it in such a way as to indicate that it isn’t a conflict. As I sat down to add in the new logic, I realized that the path I had been going down wasn’t going to work well given this new scenario.  What I really needed to do is to do some major refactoring.  In fact, you might even say I had to rewrite most of the code I had in place.  Now, in the past, I would have been afraid to tear up all that I had done and start over because it would have meant I would have to retest all that I had already worked on … manually!  But, since I already had tests in place, I was able to 1) commit what I had done so far to version control so I could get it back if I needed and 2) rip up what I had done, rewrite and refactor so that it would work well with the new requirement and 3) retest with the tests I ALREADY had in place.  I’ve added another 100 tests for the new scenarios and I’m pretty confident that the code I’ve written does what it should and doesn’t do what it shouldn’t. And that whole refactoring exercise took less than 7 hours. Oh.  And I have 100% code coverage!</p>

        <p>Over the last several months we’ve looked at several different aspects of how JavaScript deals with objects.  A few weeks ago, we looked at <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/javascript-types-nuance/">JavaScript Types</a> and noted that many of the types are actually objects, while not all are.  We’ve also looked at <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/javascript-objectswhat-you-dont-know-can-hurt-you/">JavaScript Objects</a> and <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/javascript-fields/">JavaScript Object Fields</a>.  This has all been foundational information you need to understand prior to understanding how JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/image-1.png" alt="JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance" title="JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance"> </p>
<h2 id="No-Classes"><a href="#No-Classes" class="headerlink" title="No Classes"></a>No Classes</h2><p>If you are coming from an object oriented background, the first thing you need to understand is that JavaScript doesn’t have classes.  Even though the class keyword was introduced in ES2015, there are still no classes.  All the class keyword does for us is formalizes what we’ve been doing for years while making JavaScript feel more like the other languages we know. I’m not going to spend a lot of time dealing with ES2015 syntax here for several reasons.  First, it isn’t fully implemented in the browser eco system yet.  Second, most of what we do as programmers is maintain existing code.  There is a lot of existing code that doesn’t use ES2015 yet.  Third, ES2015 hides what is really going on.  I want you to understand how JavaScript works, not just be able to churn out code. So, if there are no classes, how does JavaScript achieve inheritance?  By using the delegation pattern.</p>
<h2 id="Delegation"><a href="#Delegation" class="headerlink" title="Delegation"></a>Delegation</h2><p>In the object oriented world that you are probably coming from, you’ve probably heard the phrase, “Favor composition over inheritance.”  What they are really saying is, “Favor delegation over inheritance.”  So, this shouldn’t be a particularly new concept.  When you create a class that contains other classes, once the class is instantiated, when we need to call a function that the top level class doesn’t implement, we pass it on into an object that is contained by the top level object.  This is delegation. Now, remove the classes.  All you have left are the objects those classes would have created.  This is JavaScript.  But, instead of leaving the delegation to you, they’ve provided a default delegation mechanism called the prototype.  In fact, if you’ve ever inspected a JavaScript object in the debugger, you’ve probably seen this field hanging off your functions.  The other place you’ll see evidence of the prototype is in the __proto__ field that hangs off of every object.</p>
<h2 id="Default-Inheritance"><a href="#Default-Inheritance" class="headerlink" title="Default Inheritance"></a>Default Inheritance</h2><p>Whenever you create a new object using either an object literal, or a function (or the class keyword) the prototype field automatically points to the default empty object.  It is this default object that gives all of our other objects the behavior of an object.  Without this, none of our objects would have a default toString() implementation, for example.  It is the default object that gives all other object their object-ness.</p>
<h2 id="Constructors"><a href="#Constructors" class="headerlink" title="Constructors"></a>Constructors</h2><p>Once your head stops spinning, come back and check this out.  While we no longer have classes, we still need some way of stamping out objects that all look the same.  We already looked at one way of doing this when we discussed <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/javascript-objectswhat-you-dont-know-can-hurt-you/">JavaScript Objects</a>.</p>
<p>function A(){<br>    var self = this;<br>    self.someProperty = ‘A’;<br>    self.someFunction = function(){<br>        self.someProperty = ‘B’;<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>And for most of the code we write, this is a perfectly adequate way of creating a constructor. By attaching the functions to the function’s prototype field, we can apply the functionality one more level up the tree, which gives us a certain amount of flexibility. The same code above could be written as:</p>
<p>function A(){<br>    this.someProperty = ‘A’;<br>}</p>
<p>A.prototype.someFunction = function(){<br>    this.someProperty = ‘B’;<br>}</p>
<p>Notice that we didn’t attach someProperty to the prototype.  We want the state information attached to our object.  If you did attach it to the prototype, all it would do is give the object a default value of ‘A’ but as soon as we assign ‘B’ to it, the property gets shadowed anyhow.  If you were to Object.define() someProperty so that it had a setter, which would remove the shadowing, you would also change the value for every instance of the object A when you changed it from any instance.  I suppose if you wanted to implement something that looked like a static variable, this is something you might attempt. The key to remember here is that anything you do to the prototype is going to impact all current and future instances of the object.</p>
<h2 id="JavaScript-Prototypal-Inheritance"><a href="#JavaScript-Prototypal-Inheritance" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance"></a>JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance</h2><p>By now, I hope you understand that all inheritance happens by delegation through the prototype.  The next obvious question would be, “How do I make one JavaScript ‘class’ inherit/delegate to another ‘class’?” One way you might be tempted to implement inheritance is by assigning prototypes.</p>
<p>function A(){<br>}</p>
<p>A.prototype.foo = function(){<br>}</p>
<p>function B(){<br>}</p>
<p>B.prototype.bar = function(){<br>}</p>
<p>B.prototype = A.prototype;</p>
<p>But all this does is make B inherit from the same thing A inherited from.  Not exactly what we wanted to see happen. OK, you say.  I know what to do, I’ll just create a new object of type A and assign THAT to the prototype of B.</p>
<p>B.prototype = new A();</p>
<p>You’re closer and it may work a lot of the time, but if your A function that you are using to create that other object does anything, you may end up not doing what you expected.  For really simple objects, this will work, but it is a dangerous habit to get into. What you really want to do is to use the Object.create() function.  This creates a new object without calling the constructor function.  No side effects.</p>
<p>B.prototype = Object.create(A.prototype);</p>
<p>But, what if that A constructor function did something important? In your B constructor function, you call the A constructor function passing it the current this pointer.</p>
<p>function B() {<br>    A.call(this);<br>}</p>
<p>If B takes parameter than need to be passed on up to A, you can pass those additional parameters after this in your call to call(). And that is how we make JavaScript inherit one object from another.  It is a lot of work.  This is why ES2015 introduces the class and extend keywords.  They do a lot of this work for us.</p>

        <p>The story goes that there were two men, Joe and Frank, who were camping out in the woods when a bear showed up in the camp.  Terrified, they decided the best they could do would be to stay perfectly still until the bear left.  Hopefully, the bear wouldn’t notice them.  As the bear was poking around, Joe says to Frank, “What are we going to do if this doesn’t work?”  Frank says, “Run!”  Joe says, “You really think we can out run a bear?”  Frank says, “I don’t need to out run the bear.  I only need to out run you.” [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/image.png" alt="9 Ways to Improve" title="9 Ways to Improve"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/internetarchivebookimages/14767148885/">Internet Archive Book Images</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt.com</a> / <a href="//flickr.com/commons/usage/">No known copyright restrictions</a>[/caption]  For years I have used this story to encourage my kids to be better than their peers.  Right now, most people are so “out of shape” that “running faster” than the competition is easy.  By comparison, my kids look awesome when by any other measure, they are probably only doing the bare minimum necessary.  This is not to say they aren’t REALLY good at what they do but, there is always room for improvement.</p>
<h2 id="Average-Programmers"><a href="#Average-Programmers" class="headerlink" title="Average Programmers"></a>Average Programmers</h2><p>And then there are conversations I have with other programmers.  So many think they are great when they are only slightly better than the people they are working with.  The lack of desire to learn more, to be any better than adequate, is appalling.  And this is to say nothing of the programmers who never make the cut.  The ones I never work with because the people I work with and for won’t hire them.  I’ve been a part of some of those interviews. People who can’t answer the most basic of <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/7-c-interview-questions-that-weed-out-the-losers/">C#</a>, ASP.NET, or <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/7-javascript-interview-questions-to-weed-out-imposters/">JavaScript questions</a>.  This is to say nothing of <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/5-reasons-learning-terminology-increases-your-effectiveness-as-a-programmer/">people who believe knowing concepts trumps knowing the terms</a> that specify them.</p>
<h2 id="Average-Organizations"><a href="#Average-Organizations" class="headerlink" title="Average Organizations"></a>Average Organizations</h2><p>And then there are the organizations who settle for frameworks that provide “Silver Bullet” answers to problems.  Not because this is technically, the best solutions, but because this is the solution the requires the least from the developers they have working for them.  The problem with this approach is that it doesn’t demand excellence from the programming team that works for them.  And don’t get me started on managers who think they are “doing Agile” who obviously don’t even recognize that “Agile” is not a noun. The problem with comparing ourselves to our peers is that you can always find someone worse than yourself.  Not only is this true because you will always find someone who just doesn’t care, but even if we all cared, there will always be someone, who for any number of reasons, can’t be as good as you are.</p>
<h2 id="Be-Awesome"><a href="#Be-Awesome" class="headerlink" title="Be Awesome"></a>Be Awesome</h2><p>But we can all strive to be the best. As programmers, what if we all decided to make as our goal code so bug free that no one could find problems with the code we wrote?  Maybe there is some part of the language you program in, or the framework that you use, that you’ve never tried.  How about learning it?  Is there a tool you could start using that would help you program better?  Maybe you’ve exhausted everything there is to learn about the language or framework that you use.  Maybe it is time to learn some other language. Who do you want to be? What do you want to be known for? These are interesting questions because they cause us to focus.  Do you want to be known as mediocre?  Keep coasting.  Do you want to be the person who gets the challenging problems because you are the only person who is reliable enough to give the project to? The problem with out-running your peers is that eventually, the bear will be the only thing behind you.  Where will you be?</p>
<h2 id="Action-Steps"><a href="#Action-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Action Steps"></a>Action Steps</h2><p>OK, fine.  How do we get from mediocre to awesome?</p>
<h3 id="1-Decide-to-Master-a-Skill"><a href="#1-Decide-to-Master-a-Skill" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide to Master a Skill"></a>1. Decide to Master a Skill</h3><p>I don’t care who you are or how good you are, there is still something you don’t know.  The great thing about being a programmer is that there is always something to master.  Do some sort of self-evaluation on your skills and determine to master some skill. Just by way of example, here are some possible skills you might learn.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/pluralsightTDD1">Test Driven Development</a></li>
<li>Deep Dive a Language you “Know”</li>
<li>Learn a Language You Don’t Know</li>
<li><a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/pluralsightDesignPatterns">Design Patterns</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Teach"><a href="#2-Teach" class="headerlink" title="2. Teach"></a>2. Teach</h3><p>The best way to learn a topic is to teach the topic.  There are at least two reasons for this.  First, preparing to teach makes you organize all of those scattered bits of information in your brain in a way that someone else can grasp.  Second, it will raise questions you didn’t even know you should ask.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve explained something and the person I am teaching ask a question I’ve never considered before.  If you don’t know the answer, find the answer.  You obviously don’t know your subject as well as you think you do. Here are some possible ways to teach.</p>
<ul>
<li>Host a “Lunch and Learn”</li>
<li>Start a Blog</li>
<li>Write a Book</li>
<li>Mentor a Younger Programmer</li>
<li>Present Something at a Users Group or Meet-up.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Track-Progress"><a href="#3-Track-Progress" class="headerlink" title="3. Track Progress"></a>3. Track Progress</h3><p>In the business world, they say, “what you measure, grows.”  So, measure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decrease in bugs reported.</li>
<li>Elapse time from start of project to bug free code.</li>
<li>Cyclomatic complexity of your methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-Interview-for-a-New-Job"><a href="#4-Interview-for-a-New-Job" class="headerlink" title="4. Interview for a New Job"></a>4. Interview for a New Job</h3><p>One of the things I’ve found that interviewing for new gigs does for me is that it reveals things I should know.  I find out quickly what I should know that I don’t.  And don’t be the guy who says, “If my 30 years of experience isn’t good enough for you, I don’t want your stinking job.”  Answer the questions, not matter how much experience you have.  You might just learn something.  If you don’t know the answer, after the interview, go find the answer.  Don’t be like, “why should I keep that in my brain?”  I mean, that might be true, but go find the answer too. I had one of those interviews.  I wrote a whole post about it that I deleted.  They had me doing something I was unable to do and that I felt the rest of my knowledge and skills more than compensated for.  But, after the interview, I went and found out how to do what they had asked.</p>
<h3 id="5-Change-Jobs"><a href="#5-Change-Jobs" class="headerlink" title="5. Change Jobs"></a>5. Change Jobs</h3><p>This probably sounds like odd advice, but as a contract programmer, I’ve been on assignments that have lasted as long as 8 years and I’ve been on assignments that were as short as 4 months.  What I’ve learned is that the longer I stay on an assignment, the staler my skills become.  That 8-year gig nearly made me unmarketable.  Why?  Because I never had to learn something new.  The only reason I am still marketable is because I started learning newer stuff toward then end of that gig.  When the gig was changing every 2 years or so, I was a lot more capable of moving into a new position.  Now, I’m learning all the time.  Learning what I think will make me more marketable as well as what I would really like to be doing next.  Some of that makes its way into what I’m doing today.  Some of it will have to wait.  But it is all experience and it is all valuable.  The point is, don’t get stuck knowing what you know.  Switching jobs is the fast way to achieve that.</p>
<h3 id="6-Ask-for-a-Code-Review"><a href="#6-Ask-for-a-Code-Review" class="headerlink" title="6. Ask for a Code Review"></a>6. Ask for a Code Review</h3><p>To be clear, what you are asking for is a review of your code, not how pretty it is.  Although, depending on how much experience you have, there may be some benefit in having your code reviewed for formatting as well as clarity. What I would hope you would get out of this exercise is several, “Have you considered doing it this way…” kind of comments.  If you can’t get someone to review your code, there are some great code cop kind of tools available for every language that you can have review your code for common mistakes.  But even better if you can get another human to look at your code. It is interesting, I’ve been coding for 28 years and I’ve lost track of how many companies I’ve worked for.  There was only one company that I’ve ever worked for that did code reviews.</p>
<h3 id="7-Change-Your-Body-Language"><a href="#7-Change-Your-Body-Language" class="headerlink" title="7. Change Your Body Language"></a>7. Change Your Body Language</h3><p>This probably seems like really odd advice so let me explain.  Or maybe you’ve already seen the <a href="//www.ted.com/speakers/amy_cuddy">Ted talk</a> by Amy Cuddy that says the research shows that if you assume a body position that says, “I’m awesome” you are more likely to feel awesome.  But you may wonder what feeling awesome has to do with BEING awesome. Well, in my experience, you end up being who you believe yourself to be.  One way of hacking yourself into being awesome is to convince yourself that you are.  The best way to do that is to assume body positions that communicate that you are. Don’t think this is possible?  I grew up walking toe out.  At some point in High School or College, I read that it was more efficient to walk with my feet parallel to each other.  I started concentrating on changing how I walk.  Now I no longer think about it.  I haven’t thought about it for years. I’ve done the same thing with my body position.  Not as hard a modification, but I’ve noticed that it DOES work.</p>
<h3 id="8-Don’t-Brag"><a href="#8-Don’t-Brag" class="headerlink" title="8. Don’t Brag"></a>8. Don’t Brag</h3><p>The other thing that changing your body language will do is that it will communicate that you are confident and you’ll never have to say a word.  I believe I’m pretty good at what I do, but my general practice is to let what I know be discovered.  As I’ve observed my peers, I’ve found that the more they proclaim how great they are, the less confident they are that they really are, and generally, they aren’t.  You don’t want to be that person.  You want to portray confidence to be confident, but you want to be discovered.  “Even a fool, when he is silent, is considered wise.” and “Better to be silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.”</p>
<h3 id="9-Focus-On-One-Thing"><a href="#9-Focus-On-One-Thing" class="headerlink" title="9. Focus On One Thing"></a>9. Focus On One Thing</h3><p>The temptation, if you are motivated at all, is to try to improve in every area all at once.  That is a recipe for disaster.  Focus on one thing.  I didn’t change how I walked and how I talked and how I ran and how I sat and… you get the picture.  I focused on how I walked.  Sometime later I focused on how I sat.  I learned how to code well and then how to do Test Driven Development.  I’m often asked how I learned all I know.  It is easy, I learned one thing at a time. How do you improve?  Leave a comment and let me know.</p>

        <p>As I’ve <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/react-js-and-associated-bits/">mentioned before</a>, I’m in the middle of putting together a React reference app and I’m doing it using <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/test-driven-learning-an-experiment/">Test Driven Development</a>.  The problem is, the standard tools for implementing ES2015 code coverage with Jest make it hard to see at a glance if you have 100% code coverage or not because of some issues with the way Jest tells Babel to do the transformations by default, the way Babel transforms the code and implements the auxiliaryCommentBefore option and the way that Istanbul parses the ignore next comments. I’ve been working on solving this problem for the last month and a half off and on.  I’ve even posted a question about this on <a href="//stackoverflow.com/questions/35986316/reactjs-0-9-code-coverage-with-es2015-class-keyword">Stack Overflow</a>, so I’m pretty sure no one else has a solution for this yet.  I’m not going to say my solution is the best way to solve this problem, but it is a solution, which is better than what we have so far. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-5.png" alt="ES2015 Code Coverage and Jest" title="ES2015 Code Coverage and Jest"> </p>
<h2 id="Diagnostics"><a href="#Diagnostics" class="headerlink" title="Diagnostics"></a>Diagnostics</h2><p>By default, when Babel transforms your code, it inserts additional functions into the code that it can call to replace the code you wrote that does not yet conform to the syntax you’ve used.  This code gets inserted at the top of the file and shows up in your code coverage reports as several conditions that didn’t get fired.  Yes, it inserts code it never uses because the functions have to work under a variety of scenarios. For those who are interested in how I figured this out.  The transform results are located in node_modules/jest-cli/.haste_cache.</p>
<h2 id="ES2015-Code-Coverage-Fix-One"><a href="#ES2015-Code-Coverage-Fix-One" class="headerlink" title="ES2015 Code Coverage Fix One"></a>ES2015 Code Coverage Fix One</h2><p>OK, so the standard recommended fix for something like this is to place</p>
<p>/* istanbul ignore next */</p>
<p>Prior to those functions.  And it just so happens that both Jest and Babel provide a mechanism for adding this comment by using the auxiliaryCommentBefore option. Only there are two problems with this.</p>
<h3 id="Problem-One"><a href="#Problem-One" class="headerlink" title="Problem One"></a>Problem One</h3><p>If you just set the property like this:</p>
<p>auxiliaryCommentBefore: ‘istanbul ignore next’</p>
<p>Your code will get transformed so that any functions added by Babel will end up looking like this:</p>
<p>/*istanbul ignore next*/function babelFunctionHere()…</p>
<p>But in order for Istanbul to pickup this comment, the code needs to look like this:</p>
<p>/* istanbul ignore next */ function babelFunctionHere()…</p>
<p>While getting the spaces on either side of ‘istanbul ignore next’ is a simple matter, we have no real control over the space that is necessary between the comment marker and the function keyword.</p>
<h3 id="Problem-Two"><a href="#Problem-Two" class="headerlink" title="Problem Two"></a>Problem Two</h3><p>The second problem with this “fix” is that even if modify the Babel code so that the comment gets inserted correctly, it doesn’t get inserted before EVERY function that Babel inserts.  If it inserts a group of functions, which it does regularly in my code, it only inserts the comment before the first function.</p>
<h2 id="ES2015-Code-Coverage-Fix-Two"><a href="#ES2015-Code-Coverage-Fix-Two" class="headerlink" title="ES2015 Code Coverage Fix Two"></a>ES2015 Code Coverage Fix Two</h2><p>What if we didn’t insert the functions in our code?  Well, it just so happens that we can do that relatively easily. There is a plug-in for Babel called ‘<a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-runtime">transform-runtime</a>’.  What this plug-in does is that it requires in the functions rather that pasting them into your code.  This way, the functions don’t exist in your code so Istanbul never sees the function block.  Pretty cool. You can add this to either your .babelrc file or the Babel section of your package.json file by adding a “plugins” section</p>
<p>“plugins”: [“transform-runtime”]</p>
<p>along with the “presets” section you should already have.</p>
<h2 id="Remaining-Issue"><a href="#Remaining-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Remaining Issue"></a>Remaining Issue</h2><p>While using transform-runtime takes care of most of the issues, there are two functions that still don’t get covered.  In fact, when you look at the transform-runtime code, you find that they are explicitly excluded and if you include them, your code won’t transpile at all. The good news is, it is only two functions and they both show up as</p>
<p>function _interop…</p>
<p>If we can get a hold of the code as it is being transformed, we should be able to do a search and replace to get the correct ‘istanbul ignore next’ string in place prior to the functions. Well, it just so happens that Jest has the ability to do exactly that.</p>
<h2 id="ES2015-Code-Coverage-Final-Fix"><a href="#ES2015-Code-Coverage-Final-Fix" class="headerlink" title="ES2015 Code Coverage Final Fix"></a>ES2015 Code Coverage Final Fix</h2><p>I’m assuming you’ve already installed <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/babel-jest">babel-jest</a>, but just in case, if you have not, install it now.  Install it using –save-dev because we are going to want to be able to modify the code.</p>
<h3 id="Quick-fix"><a href="#Quick-fix" class="headerlink" title="Quick fix:"></a>Quick fix:</h3><p>The proper way to fix this would be to write your own version of babel-jest.  But we are going for a quick fix.  Maybe we can get Facebook to implement the changes from this post.  Meanwhile, here is what you want to do. Locate the src/index.js file in the node_modules/babel-jest directory.  At the time of this writing, the current version looks like this:</p>

<p>module.exports = {<br>  process(src, filename) {<br>    if (babel.util.canCompile(filename)) {<br>      return babel.transform(src, {<br>        auxiliaryCommentBefore: ‘ istanbul ignore next ‘,<br>        filename,<br>        presets: [jestPreset],<br>        retainLines: true,<br>      }).code;<br>    }<br>    return src;<br>  },<br>};</p>
<p>The first change that you want to make here is to comment out the auxiliaryCommentBefore line.  We no longer need that.</p>
<p>‘use strict’;</p>
<p>const babel = require(‘babel-core’);<br>const jestPreset = require(‘babel-preset-jest’);</p>
<p>module.exports = {<br>  process(src, filename) {<br>    if (babel.util.canCompile(filename)) {<br>      return babel.transform(src, {<br>//        auxiliaryCommentBefore: ‘ istanbul ignore next ‘,<br>        filename,<br>        presets: [jestPreset],<br>        retainLines: true,<br>      }).code;<br>    }<br>    return src;<br>  },<br>};</p>
<p>You will notice that what gets returned is the resulting transform of the code.  We want to execute a search and replace on the transformed code.  So, instead of</p>
<pre><code>return babel.transform(src, {
   auxiliaryCommentBefore: &apos; istanbul ignore next &apos;,
   filename,
   presets: \[jestPreset\],
   retainLines: true,
 }).code;
</code></pre><p>What we want want to do is:</p>
<pre><code>return babel.transform(src, {
  //auxiliaryCommentBefore: &apos; istanbul ignore next &apos;,
  filename,
  presets: \[jestPreset\],
  retainLines: true,
}).code
    .replace(/function\\s_interop/g,
        &apos; /\* istanbul ignore next */ function _interop&apos;);

        <p>I was once teaching a class on JavaScript to a group of C# developers when someone asked a very logical question, “Are JavaScript Types all derived from Object?” I loved teaching this particular group because they were actively engaged in the material.  So many times, when I teach, the students simply absorb what I say, but they don’t interact with it.  They never ask the question, “What are the implications of what is being said.” My initial instinct was to say ‘no’ based on my experience with the language.  But then as I thought about it later, I thought, “But when I use the debugger on what seems to be a primitive, don’t I see it as an object?”  And as it turns out, my instinct was right.  Not everything in JavaScript is an object.  Although there is quite a bit that you wouldn’t think was an object that is. Now that we’ve covered <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/javascript-objectswhat-you-dont-know-can-hurt-you/">JavaScript Objects</a> and <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/javascript-fields/">JavaScript Object Fields</a>, it is time to move on to the specifics of JavaScript types. So, why is it, when I look at some primitive values, I see them as objects?  And which types are objects and which are primitives? [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-4.png" alt="image" title="image"> Photo via <a href="//visualhunt.com/">Visualhunt</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="A-Review-of-JavaScript-Types"><a href="#A-Review-of-JavaScript-Types" class="headerlink" title="A Review of JavaScript Types"></a>A Review of JavaScript Types</h2><p>The fundamental types available to us in JavaScript are:</p>
<ul>
<li>undefined</li>
<li>boolean</li>
<li>number</li>
<li>string</li>
<li>object</li>
<li>null</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you use the <code>typeof</code> operator on null, you’ll get back “object” as the type. While <code>null</code> is a unique type, it makes sense for <code>typeof</code> to return “object” since the only kind of variable that could return a <code>null</code> would be an <code>object</code>.</p>
<h2 id="When-is-an-object-not-and-object"><a href="#When-is-an-object-not-and-object" class="headerlink" title="When is an object not and object?"></a>When is an object not and object?</h2><p>There is one other common type that is a bit of an odd ball.  The function type. What makes function odd is that it is, technically it is a sub-type of object.  This is good to know, and will put you light years ahead of your peers once you realize the implications.  Because a function IS an object, you can give a function additional fields.  In fact, a common way to override a function looks like this:</p>
<p>a = ‘abc’;</p>
<p>var originalSubstring;<br>var substringOverload = function(a,b){<br>    return originalSubstring(a,b);<br>}</p>
<p>originalSubstring = a.substr;<br>a.substr = substringOverload;</p>
<p>console.log(a.substr(0,1));</p>
<p>(Note: the code above won’t really work, I’m just illustrating a point). You may have done something like the above using functions in libraries.  As long as the field is not read-only, you can do this kind of overload of a function. But, a better way, now that we know that a function is just an object, is to assign the old function as a field of the original function:</p>
<p>a = ‘abc’;</p>
<p>var substringOverload = function(a,b){<br>    return substringOverload.substr(a,b);<br>}</p>
<p>substringOverload.substr = a.substr;<br>a.substr = substringOverload;</p>
<p>console.log(a.substr(0,1));</p>
<h2 id="What-about-Arrays"><a href="#What-about-Arrays" class="headerlink" title="What about Arrays?"></a>What about Arrays?</h2><p>Another place you may not be used to thinking clearly about variable types is with Arrays.  You might think an array is its own type.  That an Array is an Array.  But in reality, Arrays are a type of Object.  In fact, if you were to run the typeof operator against a variable that holds an Array, you would see that it is an object. Once again, because you know this, you can use this information to your advantage. You could provide your array, its own implementation of each:</p>
<p>Array.prototype.each = function(callback){<br>    for(var i = 0;i &lt; this.length;i++){<br>        callback(this[i]);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>var a = [1,2,3];</p>
<p>a.each(function(item){<br>    console.log(item);<br>});</p>
<p>This is essentially how polyfills are created.  If you write one, make sure you put in the additional code to make sure the function isn’t already implemented.  And don’t ever add a function to a native object like this without it having been declared by the standards committee as a function that is part of the spec.  Polyfills exist so that you can make older JavaScript implementations work as though they were using newer standards.  Not so we can add our own new functions to the language.  If you do, you could find yourself having a maintenance nightmare on your hands some day in the future.</p>
<h2 id="Newing-a-Type"><a href="#Newing-a-Type" class="headerlink" title="Newing a Type"></a>Newing a Type</h2><p>You can also write JavaScript that looks like this:</p>
<p>var someNumber = new Number(3);<br>var someString = new String(‘abc’);<br>var someBool = new Boolean(true);</p>
<p>Which will give you an Object that contains the value we passed in.  And each of those object will have Number, String, or Boolean functions available to it. But, you don’t have to new a Number, String or Boolean to get those functions.  You can get the same ability by simply assigning the value to the variable.  Under the hood, when you want to use the function that are available to all objects, the JavaScript runtime will “box” the number, string, or boolean as an object so that you can access, for example, hasOwnProperty().</p>

        <p>Over the last year, in particular, I’ve developed a technique for developing the client side of a web application using JavaScript, HTML and CSS that has significantly improved my development speed.  Once I tell you, it will be obvious.  At least, it is to me … now.  But as obvious as it is, I rarely see this technique used on any of the applications my peers are working on. And while this technique is an outgrowth of my involvement with TDD, this particular technique can be used with or without TDD. [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-3.png" alt="Do This To Increase Your Client Side Web Development Speed" title="Do This To Increase Your Client Side Web Development Speed"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/jdhancock/4367347854/">JD Hancock</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Presentation-First"><a href="#Presentation-First" class="headerlink" title="Presentation First"></a>Presentation First</h2><p>For most of my career, I’ve always like to develop applications from the top down.  That is, get the GUI up first.  Don’t make it work.  Just get a picture up that you can show to the client. This isn’t the “trick” I have in mind for improving your speed.  But if you aren’t already doing this, the trick won’t help you much. The reason “Presentation First” is so important is because of a simple truth I’ve come to realize over the years.  “No one really knows what they want until they see it.”  This is particularly true in software development because, try as we have over the last several decades, we still have not come up with a way of showing in pictures what it is we are going to build. The other reason developing the GUI first is important is because it gives the client a sense that you are making rapid development.  It is amazing how much time you’ll have without interruption when you’ve been able to show something that looks really close to the real thing.</p>
<h2 id="Attaching-Data"><a href="#Attaching-Data" class="headerlink" title="Attaching Data"></a>Attaching Data</h2><p>The next step in my development cycle typically involves attaching data to the presentation.  Most of the programmers I know do this by making whatever REST call they need to make to the server and displaying whatever they get back.  There are at least three problems with this. First, as the data in your database changes, what displays in your presentation changes.  If you are working with a local database that you have complete control over, that is a minor problem.  But if you are, as so many of my clients are, using a common development database, you can’t be sure that the data you are playing with won’t change. Second, you really can’t be sure that what you are displaying is actually the correct fields unless you go into your database and change the contents of the fields to represent what the fields contain so that you can display that on your data. Finally, developing in this way is going to be much slower than it needs to be.</p>
<h2 id="The-Trick"><a href="#The-Trick" class="headerlink" title="The Trick"></a>The Trick</h2><p>Here’s the deal.  The way most of us develop applications, once we get to the part where we need to attach some data, we attach it directly to the REST end point.  At the very least, this slows our development time down because every time we load the app to make sure it is doing what we had in mind, we have to wait for it to load the data from the server as well. But aside from the other problems I mentioned above, it also means that we are dependent on whoever is developing those other end points.  If it is you, it isn’t so bad.  But lately, I’ve been working on projects where the only thing I’ve been responsible for is developing the client side.  In my last contract, I was brought in to build an application that was dependent on data I had no control over.  I did write a little C# code to get the data from a web service into a form my JavaScript client side code could use.  But most of my time was spent writing code on the client side. But it didn’t matter, because I mocked out the data on the client side until the server side data was ready. In fact, I was able to work ahead of the guy who was providing the data BECAUSE I was mocking out the data.  The project manager spent most of that contract worried that I would end up stalled because the data wasn’t ready and I spent the same amount of time assuring her that I wouldn’t get stalled until the ONLY thing I had left to do was hook the application up to real data. At my current contract, I’m working on a team that uses Java for the back end.  How’s that?  A .NET guy working on a Java team?  Well, you see, it doesn’t matter.  I was brought in as a JavaScript specialist.  And my development methodology is the same.  I am using mock data.  When I am finally ready to see it all working live, I’ll call the REST end points that I need. But in this particular Java environment, there is an additional hurdle.  If I were to develop this application the way most of my peers are developing, I would need to build the application into JAR, WAR and EAR files and copy those files over to the JBoss server.  While I have created a script for this using Node JS and NPM, the time this takes is a bit excessive. So, instead, what I’ve done is I’ve created a separate project for the bits I’m working on.  I’ve setup an Express server using Node JS and installed proxy middleware as my last route handler.  It is setup to point to the JBoss server for anything it can’t find under Node.  So, any files I need that have already been built, I can grab from JBoss, while all of my work runs under Express. (Yes, I know Eclipse will auto deploy relatively quickly, but from what I’ve seen of the JavaScript editor, I’m not a fan of Eclipse.  Actually, from what I’ve seen of Eclipse, I’m not a fan.) What this means is that I can click the run button to fire up my Express server and it loads my local JavaScript and any stuff I need from JBoss via the proxy.  I never have to deploy my work.  And I only need to wire in the real data once I have everything else working. I have the added advantage of being able to switch between my local mock data and the real data simply by loading my local data when I want mocks or the remote data when I want the real deal.  Kind of like you might do with a DI container in .NET only on the client side.</p>
<h2 id="TDD-Becomes-Trivial"><a href="#TDD-Becomes-Trivial" class="headerlink" title="TDD Becomes Trivial"></a>TDD Becomes Trivial</h2><p>And now that I’m working with known, mock data, implementing Test Driven Development is trivial.  Well, for me it is trivial.  You still need to make sure you write testable code.  But at least you don’t have to worry about the data part of TDD.</p>

        <p>If you are using one of the many frameworks that say they are using JavaScript MVVM, you might not be using it the way it should be used. Many of my clients aren’t. This article will attempt to answer three questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is MVVM?</li>
<li>What are the advantages of MVVM?</li>
<li><p>What are good MVVM coding practices?</p>
<p>[caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-1.png" alt="JavaScript &amp; MVVM" title="JavaScript &amp; MVVM"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/uka0310/8038385310/">uka0310</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>

</ul>
<h2 id="What-is-JavaScript-MVVM"><a href="#What-is-JavaScript-MVVM" class="headerlink" title="What is JavaScript MVVM?"></a>What is JavaScript MVVM?</h2><p>The first question we need to ask before we can ever start coding is, “What is MVVM?”  The reason for this is that if you don’t understand what this design pattern is attempting to do, you’ll probably ending up making some pretty severe coding mistakes when it comes time to implement it. In the MVVM design pattern, like the MVC design pattern, the first M represents the Model and the first V represents the View.  As with MVC, the Model represents the data you are trying to manipulate.  The View represents the presentation layer.  In MVVM, there is also an entity called a ViewModel which is an object or set of objects that represent the View’s State.  This would include any data you want to present from your Model as well as ancillary states such as what elements are enabled/disabled or visible/hidden.  Not that these are the only items.  This is just a few examples. What makes MVVM cool is that you don’t have to worry about how data gets from the View to the ViewModel or from the ViewModel back into the View.  That all happens automatically.  Although, depending on the implementation, you might have to write a bit more code to notify the View that something changed in the ViewModel so that it knows to update itself. But, you may be left wondering, “Where do event handlers go?” Well, that is one of the things I find confusing about calling it MVVM.  Because in every implementation I’ve ever worked on, there is still a controller of some sorts.  Or, call it a ViewController.  It is the thing that responds to events in the view and updates the ViewModel as needed. So, in general, you have a View that updates the ViewModel automatically and fires events to the ViewController.  This is all specified declaratively.  When an event is fired, the ViewController responds to the event and updates the ViewModel with any state changes.  When the ViewModel changes, it notifies the View that the View should update the presentation.  When the controller needs to know about the current state of the View, it ask the ViewModel for that information because it should be reflected there. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-2.png" alt="JavaScript MVVM" title="JavaScript MVVM"> If you’ve ever used one of the many MVVM frameworks out there, you’ll recognize that many of them combine the ViewModel and the ViewController into one entity.  I’ve separated them out here for clarity and because I believe that if all possible, they should be maintained separately to maintain the Single Responsibility Principle.  However I recognize that the best you may be able to do is provide to separate sections in one class.  The main point here is that any state changes to the view happen because the ViewModel was updated and not because the ViewController called into the View to make the change.</p>
<h2 id="What-JavaScript-MVVM-is-Not"><a href="#What-JavaScript-MVVM-is-Not" class="headerlink" title="What JavaScript MVVM is Not"></a>What JavaScript MVVM is Not</h2><p>One rookie mistake with any MV* design pattern is that many programmers think that the View, ViewModel or ViewController are the only three places where code can live in this pattern.  But the truth of the matter is, the pattern only describes how to handle the organization of your presentation code.  MVVM does not specify where your business rules should be located.  But one place they should not go is in your ViewController.  The only code that should be in your ViewController is code that updates or retrieves information from the ViewModel, or code that calls out to another class to perform some sort of business rules.</p>
<h2 id="Advantages-of-JavaScript-MVVM"><a href="#Advantages-of-JavaScript-MVVM" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of JavaScript MVVM"></a>Advantages of JavaScript MVVM</h2><p>While there are many advantages to using MVVM, the top three on my list are:</p>
<h3 id="View-Refactoring"><a href="#View-Refactoring" class="headerlink" title="View Refactoring"></a>View Refactoring</h3><p>I’ve worked on several systems in the past where it was necessary for my code to know what more about the View that it should have.  Whenever I wanted to change the ID of an element in my view, it was necessary for me to update code in other parts of my system or the code would break.  When you are using MVVM properly, you can not only change your view however you want, but you don’t have to even have an ID if you don’t need to for some other reason (like running Selenium Tests).</p>
<h3 id="Interchangeable"><a href="#Interchangeable" class="headerlink" title="Interchangeable"></a>Interchangeable</h3><p>In fact, if you wanted to, you could create multiple views and associate each of them with the same ViewModel and ViewController.  You might create a View for a version of you application that runs on the desktop and another View for a version that runs on a phone.  Implemented correctly, you may have state information in your ViewModel that never makes it to the View because the version of the View you are currently running doesn’t display that information.</p>
<h3 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h3><p>For me, the most compelling reason to us MVVM is because it makes it much easier to test my application.  You only need to be able to tell the ViewController where the ViewModel is.  You can call the event handlers directly in your test and verify that they update the ViewModel correctly without ever having to create a View.  Since the View is declarative, you can trust that your framework will do what it should and leave testing the View to a larger Application level test rather than trying to unit test it.</p>
<h2 id="JavaScript-MVVM-Best-Practices"><a href="#JavaScript-MVVM-Best-Practices" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript MVVM Best Practices"></a>JavaScript MVVM Best Practices</h2><h3 id="Never-Call-the-View-from-the-ViewController"><a href="#Never-Call-the-View-from-the-ViewController" class="headerlink" title="Never Call the View from the ViewController"></a>Never Call the View from the ViewController</h3><p>There are several ways I typically see this rule violated.  The first, and most obvious is when the view is called to retrieve or set state information instead of using the ViewModel.  But another way I typically see this violated is when programmers insist or writing event wire-up code in the ViewController.  The reason wiring up event handlers is a bad idea is because now I have to have some sort of DOM locator code in my ViewController.  This means if I change the identifier or the location of the DOM item, I have to come in and change my locator code.  One way of testing if the code you are writing belongs where you are writing it is to ask the question, “If I executed this code without the View, would it still work correctly?”</p>
<h3 id="Event-Handlers-Should-Be-Light"><a href="#Event-Handlers-Should-Be-Light" class="headerlink" title="Event Handlers Should Be Light"></a>Event Handlers Should Be Light</h3><p>As I mentioned above, you don’t want to have any more code in your ViewController than is absolutely necessary to update the ViewModel.  This will often mean calling out to some other object to get the actual work done.</p>
<h3 id="ViewModel-Should-Only-Contain-ViewState"><a href="#ViewModel-Should-Only-Contain-ViewState" class="headerlink" title="ViewModel Should Only Contain ViewState"></a>ViewModel Should Only Contain ViewState</h3><p>It might be tempting to put executable code in your ViewModel at times.  Resist this urge.  If you need a computed property, that’s one thing.  If you start processing business logic, you are probably headed down the wrong path.  My general test here is this.  If I need to write a test case against my ViewModel code directly to get 100% code coverage, I’ve probably coded something wrong.  Of course, you have to be writing unit test and a code coverage tool for this rule to work.</p>
<h2 id="If-You-Think-You-Need-to-Violate-A-Best-Practice"><a href="#If-You-Think-You-Need-to-Violate-A-Best-Practice" class="headerlink" title="If You Think You Need to Violate A Best Practice"></a>If You Think You Need to Violate A Best Practice</h2><p>Finally, I want to address the issue of, “What if…” This past week, I ran into a situation where the control I was using was not setup to implement MVVM the way my framework intended.  So, this problem is fresh in my mind.  The solution is almost always to extend the component and add in the hooks you need so that you can use the framework properly.  While the temptation to just get something working will be strong, your overall productivity will suffer if you start bending the rules.  If you can’t figure out how to get the code to submit, ask for help.  You may need to break some of the rules in the extension, but at least the violations are isolated from the rest of your code in such a way that if the component ever gets fixed, you can go to one location to update your code.</p>

        <p>Long time readers may remember that I started using Ext JS about 3 years ago.  At the time, I was using version 4.2.2.  I recently started a new contract where they are using Ext JS 6.0.1.  I have to say, this version solves a lot of the architectural issues I had with the 4.x series.  But, there are still problems. Since I’ve provided an evaluation of <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/angular-2-first-impressions-compared-to-angular-1/">Angular 2</a> and <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/react-js-and-associated-bits/">React JS</a>, I thought providing an evaluation of the current version of Ext JS would be appropriate since these three seem to be the main players in the corporate world. [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”400”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image.png" alt="Ext JS by Sencha - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly" title="Ext JS by Sencha - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/sanbeiji/5606497634/">sanbeiji</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">Visual Hunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Ext-JS-The-Good"><a href="#Ext-JS-The-Good" class="headerlink" title="Ext JS - The Good"></a>Ext JS - The Good</h2><h3 id="MVVM"><a href="#MVVM" class="headerlink" title="MVVM"></a>MVVM</h3><p>I’ve always had three major complaints about Ext JS.  Of the three, the fact that Ext JS is nearly impossible to test is the one that drove me away.  In fact, I almost didn’t interview for the contract I have now because they are using Ext JS.  This is because the 4.2 version that I was using implemented what they called the MVC framework.  The problem is, the MVC framework they implemented was not anything <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/designPatterns">the Gang of Four</a> would recognize.  Once I realized that what they were calling MVC wasn’t really MVC, I was able to learn how to use the product much better. But being the TDD guy that I am, I was always frustrated by their implementation of MVC because in order to test anything in the Controller, I had to have the view available.  And while I tried several ways of mitigating this problem, I was never completely satisfied with the solution.  I ought to be able to test my controller without a view, or if I have to have a view, it should be some sort of fake view, or be able to render into a fake DOM like React JS does. But, in Ext JS 6, they’ve provided an alternate framework.  This time it is also more accurately named.  They have provided an MVVM implementation.  In the View, you provide your layout, declarative syntax to access the View’s state from the ViewModel and to specify the event handlers using listener blocks that tell the view what methods to call in the associated ViewController class. In the ViewController, your methods can access the ViewModel by calling getModel() and can set the state of the view by calling the ViewModel’s set() method.  Once this is done, the View can update using the ViewModel’s new state. What this means for testing is that I can test without the View by overriding the ViewContoller.getModel() method to return the ViewModel.  Run my test for a method and check the state of the ViewModel.  Look Ma, no View!</p>
<h3 id="Everything-You-Need"><a href="#Everything-You-Need" class="headerlink" title="Everything You Need"></a>Everything You Need</h3><p>One of the biggest selling points for using Ext JS is that just about everything you could need is provided for you in once product.  Unlike Angular or React JS where one project provides the framework and another project or projects provide components, nearly everything you are going to need for your application is provided out of the box.  This is not to say that there aren’t third party providers for Ext JS, but the need for them is very limited.</p>
<h3 id="Consistent-Rendering"><a href="#Consistent-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="Consistent Rendering"></a>Consistent Rendering</h3><p>One of the major attractions Ext has offered is that you don’t need to worry about cross browser rendering issues.  If you still need to support REALLY old browsers, this may still be a big selling point for you.  I think this will matter less in the future as the browsers continue to stabilize around standards.</p>
<h3 id="Responsive-Adaptive"><a href="#Responsive-Adaptive" class="headerlink" title="Responsive/Adaptive"></a>Responsive/Adaptive</h3><p>Even though Ext JS uses a none standard way of rendering controls (see below) they do manage to achieve Adaptive and Responsive designs.</p>
<h3 id="Ability-to-Control-DOM-Manipulation"><a href="#Ability-to-Control-DOM-Manipulation" class="headerlink" title="Ability to Control DOM Manipulation"></a>Ability to Control DOM Manipulation</h3><p>Finally, if you are having trouble achieving performance with the current way you are rending DOM changes, you will be happy to know that Ext JS does provide a way of turning of rendering to the DOM while you make all the changes and then turning it back on to do the final rendering.  But, at least my last usage of this, indicates that it doesn’t really turn off ALL DOM manipulation.  If you are inserting new DOM elements, those go out to the screen.  All Ext JS really does is to turn off their layout code.</p>
<h3 id="Who-Ya-Gonna-Call"><a href="#Who-Ya-Gonna-Call" class="headerlink" title="Who Ya Gonna Call?"></a>Who Ya Gonna Call?</h3><p>One of the strongest reasons many organizations choose Ext JS is because the price of the license gives you access to Sencha support.  Companies I’ve worked for have used this for everything from “My code doesn’t work, what am I doing wrong?” and actually getting an answer to “I think you have a bug here.” and getting the bug fixed.  Kind of a private StackOverflow with direct access to the programmers who wrote the framework.</p>
<h2 id="Ext-JS-The-Bad"><a href="#Ext-JS-The-Bad" class="headerlink" title="Ext JS - The Bad"></a>Ext JS - The Bad</h2><h3 id="Lock-In"><a href="#Lock-In" class="headerlink" title="Lock In"></a>Lock In</h3><p>If you decide to use Ext JS, you are really making a much more significant commitment than if you were choosing to use either Angular or React.  With either of those two, I can write standard JavaScript and I can mix and match several different existing frameworks.  Since just about everything in Ext JS is proprietary, mixing and matching is not only frowned upon, but they warn against it.  If you are using Ext JS, you are going to use ALL of Ext JS for everything.</p>
<h3 id="Use-Strict"><a href="#Use-Strict" class="headerlink" title="Use Strict"></a>Use Strict</h3><p>Standard JS best practice recommends placing “use strict”; at the top of you IIFE block to protect you from making stupid mistakes.  Unfortunately, you can’t do this in your Ext JS code without having to work around the problems it produces.</p>
<h3 id="String-Based"><a href="#String-Based" class="headerlink" title="String Based"></a>String Based</h3><p>Ext JS is probably the most string based language I’ve ever seen.  While they now have plugins for some of the more popular IDEs that mitigate against the risk this imposes on your code, in terms of good solid JavaScript, there are much better ways of writing code than what Ext JS forces you into.</p>
<h3 id="Nesting-Issues"><a href="#Nesting-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Nesting Issues"></a>Nesting Issues</h3><p>As I mentioned above, Ext JS does their own layouts in order to achieve a presentation that will look the same regardless of what browser it is running on.  However, the cost of this is that if you nest components too deeply, rendering your view or changes to your view, will take significantly longer than anyone is willing to wait around for.  So, to get around this, you end up writing sub optimal code from just about every coding principle in existence.  Specifically, DRY and SRP are difficult to achieve using Ext JS views.</p>
<h3 id="Version-X-0-0-is-Always-Broken"><a href="#Version-X-0-0-is-Always-Broken" class="headerlink" title="Version X.0.0 is Always Broken"></a>Version X.0.0 is Always Broken</h3><p>I’ve complained about this publicly before.  But it seems to me, and everyone else I talk with that has used Ext JS that every .0.0 version is buggy.  Things that used to work in the previous version no longer work.  Despite the assertion from Sencha that they have thousands of tests.  I always wonder what kind of code coverage they have and if they have a test that covers every feature for every component they have documented.</p>
<h2 id="Ext-JS-The-Ugly"><a href="#Ext-JS-The-Ugly" class="headerlink" title="Ext JS - The Ugly"></a>Ext JS - The Ugly</h2><h3 id="Ugly-HTML"><a href="#Ugly-HTML" class="headerlink" title="Ugly HTML"></a>Ugly HTML</h3><p>There is a lot that is ugly about Ext JS, but nothing is more visibly ugly than the HTML it produces.  This is because, in order to produces a view that will render on any browser, they’ve resorted to using HTML tables to wrap just about every standard control.  This is getting better.  There is less HTML generated in Ext JS 6 than there was in Ext JS 4, but it is still relatively ugly. And that whole nesting issue could go away tomorrow if they would give up on trying to control the rendering of the view through JavaScript.  Why do with JavaScript what CSS was designed to do and does MUCH better?!</p>
<h3 id="SASS-isn’t-SASS"><a href="#SASS-isn’t-SASS" class="headerlink" title="SASS isn’t SASS"></a>SASS isn’t SASS</h3><p>Up until version 6, Sencha’s theming engine used standard SASS.  With version 6, they’ve dumped standard SASS for their own implementation that mostly does what SASS does but has a few embellishments that aren’t all bad, except for the fact that they still kept the SASS extensions for the files and the syntax is mostly the same.</p>
<h3 id="None-Standard-JavaScript"><a href="#None-Standard-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="None Standard JavaScript"></a>None Standard JavaScript</h3><p>But of all the issues I have with Ext JS 6, the one that bugs me the most is that their framework provides something that runs on JavaScript but really isn’t JavaScript.  They have their own way of declaring a class.  Their own way of instantiating a class.  Their own requires engine.  Their own bundling and minification engine. And since I can’t even use “use strict”; in what they have now – something that has been around long enough that it should be supported by every seriously used framework in existence – it makes me wonder what future embellishments to the JavaScript language we won’t be able to use because Sencha thinks they have a better idea. Will I be able to use the “class” keyword in the future instead of Ext.define()?</p>
<h3 id="None-Standard-Build-Tools"><a href="#None-Standard-Build-Tools" class="headerlink" title="None Standard Build Tools"></a>None Standard Build Tools</h3><p>Not only does Ext JS use none standard JavaScript, but they are using their own proprietary build tools to deploy the final applications.  Along with using their own version of SASS, they also have their own implementation of bundling and minification.  Why not use gulp or grunt and allow us to bundle our apps our way?  Oh, right, they have their own implementation of requires too.  And now they want to sell us proprietary testing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, is Ext JS for you?  That’s a good question.  You’ll need to evaluate if the good parts outweigh the bad parts.  It isn’t like either Angular or React have everything.  There is no perfect choice.  There is the best choice for you and your organization.</p>

        <p>Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve mentioned that I’ve been learning React JS.  First in the article “<a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/react-js-and-associated-bits/">Reaction to React JS and Associated Bits</a>” and then last week in my article “<a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/test-driven-learning-an-experiment/">Test Driven Learning</a>”.  In the first article,  I mentioned that if you use React JS, you’ll probably end up using the Flux design pattern and since there are multiple ways of implementing flux, getting a clear definition of what it is and how it should work can be confusing.  At least, I found it confusing. And now that I’ve figured it out, I thought it might be helpful both to myself and to the programming community at large if I offered my own Explanation of the Flux Pattern.  At the very least, it will give me one more way of solidifying the concept in my own brain.  Maybe it will be helpful to you as well. [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/image-5.png" alt="Flux" title="Flux"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/jeffreagan/22033828931/">jeffreagan</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Flux-“One-Way-Data-Binding”"><a href="#Flux-“One-Way-Data-Binding”" class="headerlink" title="Flux “One Way Data Binding”"></a>Flux “One Way Data Binding”</h2><p>One of the first concepts you’ll hear when you start to learn Flux is that Flux implements “One Way Data Binding.”  This is unfortunate because if you start implementing Flux thinking it is any kind of data binding, you are already headed in the wrong direction.  Data binding holds with it this concept that things will happen automatically and declaratively.  Neither is true in the Flux world.  In fact, the reason Flux exist at all is because, in the Flux world, control over what happens when is the reason for its existence.  So, forget data binding.  Flux is “One Way Data Flow”.</p>
<h2 id="Pub-Sub"><a href="#Pub-Sub" class="headerlink" title="Pub/Sub"></a>Pub/Sub</h2><p>Flux is heavily reliant on the pub/sub model.  Pub/sub is short for Publish/Subscribe.  This comes from the real world.  You subscribe to a newspaper, or magazine, or… whatever.  Every time the thing you subscribe to is published, you get it. It is no different in Flux.  An object will subscribe to another object.  Anytime the second object does something worth publishing, the first object gets notified.  The beauty of implementing a system in this way is that the publisher doesn’t need to know anything about the subscribers.  If there is a subscriber, the subscriber gets notified.  If there is no subscriber, nothing happens.  The subscriber does need to know something about the publisher so that he can say he wants to know when something is happening.  While you might thing this would create a tight coupling between the two, it doesn’t have to.</p>
<h2 id="Singletons"><a href="#Singletons" class="headerlink" title="Singletons"></a>Singletons</h2><p>There is a pattern in object oriented programming called “Singletons.”  Just like the name implies, this means there is only one object of that type in the system.  Some people consider Singletons evil.  But the benefit, especially in the Flux world, is that finding an instance of the object is easy.  You just ask for it.</p>
<h2 id="Flux-Dispatcher"><a href="#Flux-Dispatcher" class="headerlink" title="Flux Dispatcher"></a>Flux Dispatcher</h2><p>The Dispatcher is the central Flux object.  If you are using the Flux implementation from Facebook, your Dispatcher object will extend the Dispatcher class.  There really isn’t much too it, and you may be able to get away with just using the Dispatcher class directly.  But I create a new derived object so I can extend it if I need to. Everything in the system that needs to know when something interesting happens in the view layer of your code, subscribes to the dispatcher.  And anytime something happens in the view layer that other objects in your system might want to know about, the dispatcher is called with a message telling it what action we are looking to perform. So, in the demo app I am building, when the main view loads, the componentWillMount() method in my view sends the dispatcher a message telling it that it is looking for a list to display.</p>
<p>componentWillMount(){<br>    AppDispatch.dispatch({actionType:ActionTypes.CRUD_LIST});<br>}</p>
<p>  On the other end of this request, I have a store that has registered with the dispatcher.</p>
<p>AppDispatcher.register((action) =&gt; {<br>    switch(action.actionType){<br>        case ActionTypes.CRUD_LIST:<br>            store.list();<br>    }<br>});</p>
<p>You’ll notice that I am using “enumerations” to keep the code clean.  The reality is the ActionTypes are just strings.</p>
<h2 id="Flux-EventEmitter"><a href="#Flux-EventEmitter" class="headerlink" title="Flux EventEmitter"></a>Flux EventEmitter</h2><p>We have notifications flowing down to our store to tell it we need some information or want it to do something, like save the data.  But once that is complete, how do we let the view know that the information it needs to display has changed? Well, it is actually very similar.  The view tells the store, “Hey, any time you do something interesting with the data, let me know. So, once again we setup a Pub/Sub relationship.  This time, the store is the publisher and the view is the listener.  So, in our view, we’ll setup the listener by adding it to our componentWillMount() method</p>
<p>componentWillMount(){<br>    CrudStore.addChangeListener(self.onChange);<br>    AppDispatch.dispatch({actionType:ActionTypes.CRUD_LIST});<br>}</p>
<p>And in our store, our list() method (in this case) will send the message.</p>
<p>list(){<br>    superAgent.get(‘/api/contact’).end((error,response) =&gt; {<br>        if(!error){<br>            response.body.forEach((item) =&gt; {<br>                item.id = item._id;<br>                item.dob = new Date(item.dob);<br>            });<br>            this.emitChange(ActionTypes.CRUD_LIST,response);<br>        }<br>    });<br>}</p>
<p>I’m using superAgent here to make an ajax call that will get me the list.  When it returns, I call emitChange which will eventually call the callback I passed in from the view to tell the view that something changed.</p>
<h2 id="Push-vs-Pull"><a href="#Push-vs-Pull" class="headerlink" title="Push vs Pull"></a>Push vs Pull</h2><p>Now, there seems to be two minds about how this all should work.  Do you just notify the view that something happened and let the view go get the data it needs?  Or do you pass the data the view will need along with the notification? It would seem to me that while either one will work, if we think of Flux as “One Way” data flow, or even One Way data binding, it makes a lot more sense to push the data around.  And so, what you’ll see me do in the callbacks that live in my view code, is that they will receive the data and push it into the view state.</p>
<p>onChange(type,data){<br>    if(type === ActionTypes.CRUD_LIST){<br>        self.setState({data: data.body});<br>    }<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Visually"><a href="#Visually" class="headerlink" title="Visually"></a>Visually</h2><p><img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/image-6.png" alt="image" title="image"> The arrows represent the direction of data flow.  You can assume that if the data is flowing to something, there was a corresponding listener setup. The top windows represent the view.  The cog represents the dispatcher (you can see that it sends the notification to everything) and the disks represent the data stores.  You should note that the dispatcher notifies all of the stores because there is only one dispatcher to listen to.  Finally, since not all of the views care about all of the stores, I send notifications to particular views that care. There may be cases where you would have something at the store level that isn’t, technically, a store.  That’s OK.  But I think 99% of the time, you’ll end up having stores be thing thing that the dispatchers send information to.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I have not given a lot of implementation details here because what I wanted to convey was the overarching concept behind Flux.  Once I’ve finished my reference app for this, I may go into more detail at the implementation level.  Don’t forget to sign up for the newsletter so you don’t miss anything.</p>
