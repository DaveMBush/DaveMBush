        <p>Angular 2 is finally released.  But the biggest problem with learning Angular 2 is that it is a “Choose your own adventure” kind of framework.  And while React has a similar problem, I think Angular has out done them.  This means that you can learn bits and pieces of Angular 2, but it will be a while before you get a cohesive understanding of what choices you need to make, which choices are the right choices, and why all of this matters. And all of this is even more difficult if you are a relatively new programmer.  I’m talking those of you who have less than 5 years of experience and even some of you who have less than 10 years of experience. So, what I thought I’d do to address this very real problem is to assemble a very opinionated Angular 2 tutorial.  Over the next several weeks I plan to show you how to create a simple CRUD application using Angular 2 in a way that will scale up to larger projects.  While I may mention some of the other options along the way, what you’ll end up with is the “right way.”  OK.  To be fair, most of what I consider “right” is opinion.  Some very smart people disagree with me.  But, some other very smart people agree with me too.

<p>In this article, let’s focus on just getting a basic application up and running.</p>
<h2 id="Prerequisites"><a href="#Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h2><p>If you haven’t installed Node yet, I suggest you do that now.  <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/you-can-start-using-node-today/">Here’s an article on how to install Node if you are new to Node</a>.  Even if you think you know how to install node (“How hard can that be?”) read the article.  You might learn something.  I would recommend installing Node 6.x as of this writing or whatever the latest version is when you are reading this. You’ll also want to get an editor that has good support for TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.  I’ve heard a lot of good things about VS Code, but the editor I use is WebStorm.  If you are a .NET programmer, Visual Studio will get you kind of close.  If you can’t or won’t switch to WebStorm for your JavaScript development, at least get the ReSharper plugin for Visual Studio.  You’ll also need plugins to enable Node and TypeScript development from within Visual Studio if you haven’t installed them already. For those of you in the Java world using Eclipse.  Eclipse has the worse JavaScript support I’ve ever seen.  I understand that it is familiar, but just about any other JavaScript editor will be better. Anyhow, I’m using WebStorm.  If you are using another editor, you are on your own.</p>
<h2 id="Angular-CLI"><a href="#Angular-CLI" class="headerlink" title="Angular CLI"></a>Angular CLI</h2><p>Now that you have Node installed and you have a reasonably good JavaScript/TypeScript editor, the next thing you will want to install is the <a href="//github.com/angular/angular-cli">Angular CLI</a>.  As of this writing, the Angular CLI is at Beta .17 so I can understand that you might be hesitant to use it.  But it is done enough that we can use it to get our project going with MUCH less effort than if we did it by hand.  And hopefully, the parts we need will get completed by the time we need them. There are a few other practical reasons for using the CLI rather than coding it yourself.  First, the CLI conforms to the Angular 2 style guide.  This was developed by the team that wrote Angular 2.  Who better to tell us what the code should look like?  And while I may not always agree with some of the recommendations, I understand why they are there and I’m willing to live with them.  Hopefully, organizations coding Angular 2 applications will conform to these conventions so that anyone who writes Angular 2 code will already know them as they move from one organization to another. The instructions are on the web site for installing.  But here is what you need to do in a little more detail. First, install the angular cli globally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>npm install -g angular-cli</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, when you run <code>npm</code> commands, or <code>ng</code> commands later on, you’ll do that from the command line. The next thing you’ll want to do is create a new project using the Angular CLI.  This is where things are not as clear as I would have liked.  Probably because their development environment looks different than mine. The official documents say to run these commands</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>ng new PROJECT_NAME cd PROJECT_NAME ng serve</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where PROJECT_NAME is the name you want to give your project.  This project name will become a sub directory under the directory you executed the command from.  But what if you want to create a new project first, using your editor, and then you want to run <code>ng new</code>?  My first attempt was to run ng new using the directory where my project existed.  But that just gave me an error message that said the directory already existed.  Yeah, I know. Then I tried running <code>ng new</code> without the directory name inside the project directory.  The result of that was being told that I forgot a parameter. Well, what about using <code>ng new</code> with “.” as a parameter, meaning “current directory”.  Nope, “.” is not a valid name. It took me a while to figure this out. But you can execute <code>ng init</code> from within the directory your existing project is in and it will scaffold out your application in your current directory.</p>
<h2 id="NG-SERVE"><a href="#NG-SERVE" class="headerlink" title="NG SERVE"></a>NG SERVE</h2><p>One of the commands you’ll see above is <code>ng serve</code>. You may wonder what this is and why you would want to run it. Don’t I just deploy my application on my own server? Well, yes, eventually you will. But while you are developing the application you will want or need to test it locally. Since Angular 2 requires a build and packaging step, you’ll want to automate this as much as possible. So, before you toss the idea of using <code>ng serve</code> out, let’s take a look at what this gives you. First, <code>ng serve</code> gives you a web server to run your application.  By default, this runs on <a href="//localhost:4200">http://localhost:4200</a>.  You can try this now. Oh wait!  What’s it doing?  It looks like it is doing way more than starting a web server. Well, yes, it is.  You see <code>ng serve</code> automatically compiles all of your typescript files and bundles all of your resulting files together every time a file changes.  The first time you run <code>ng serve</code>, it will do this because everything has changed.  But it gets better, it will also refresh whatever browser is looking at the application so that your browser will always reflect whatever changes you’ve made in your source code. There are a few specific cases where this won’t work, but generally this works out pretty well. If you make a change and it doesn’t get reflected as you would expect, try restarting the server. That will probably fix the issue. The other thing you can do is that you can configure the server to proxy request to another server.  This would be useful if you want to pull data from your Java, ASP.NET, or other platform while still running ng serve for the client side development work. If everything is working so far, you should be able to pull up your browser and run the application on <a href="//localhost:4200">http://localhost:4200</a> and see a message “app works!”  It really is just the barest of all possible applications.</p>
<h2 id="What-Else"><a href="#What-Else" class="headerlink" title="What Else?"></a>What Else?</h2><p>If you are curious like I am, you may have taken a look around the file structure to see what was installed.  One directory you may have noticed is the “e2e” directory.  This is where your end to end tests go.  You can run these using the command</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ng e2e</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just make sure you have already run ng serve in another window. You can also run the unit tests that are in *.spec.ts files by running the command</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ng test</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will run the tests using Jasmine in a Chrome browser. The final thing to note about the CLI is that it uses Webpack instead of System.JS to manage bundling and minification.  As of this writing, the tour of heroes demo still uses System.JS so this might be a point of confusion for you.  The good news is that Webpack is a bit more straight forward than System.JS and I believe you’ll find it a lot easier to use.</p>

But today, I want to look more at the attitude behind these statements.</p>
<h2 id="It’s-All-in-Your-Head"><a href="#It’s-All-in-Your-Head" class="headerlink" title="It’s All in Your Head"></a>It’s All in Your Head</h2><p>Man is a funny being.  We make decisions with our hearts and justify the decisions with our brains.  Once you know this, you can hack it to your favor.  But how does this relate to what we’ve been talking about? It is really quite simple.  All of the best practices I’ve mentioned above require work to learn.  We would rather not invest the time to learn how to do these well, and so rather than just saying, “this is not where I choose to spend my time right now” we say things like, “my management won’t let me do that” or “my way is more efficient” or at times, we even resort to vilifying the practice. I have the same issue when I try to convince management that their process needs to change.  It took seven years for me to get one company to move their project management system from email to project management software.  Why?  Because what they were doing “worked” and they couldn’t see that doing something different would work better in any way.</p>
<h2 id="A-Skin-of-a-Reason"><a href="#A-Skin-of-a-Reason" class="headerlink" title="A Skin of a Reason"></a>A Skin of a Reason</h2><p>So, let’s look at the parts of these myths that are true. First, it is true that while you are learning how to use any one of these best practices, it will in fact, take you longer to write your code. Tightly coupled code is easier to reason about and one could argue is therefore easier to write. Test Driven Development is one of the most difficult things to learn.  And just like the myth that Agile/Scrum/Kanban doesn’t work, the myth that Test Driven Development doesn’t work is largely based on misconceptions about what Test Driven Development is.  Initially, it will impact the time it takes for you to write your code.  But the more interesting argument to me is that testing negatively impacts design.  If you mean that you can’t use the design you are used to using and that design involves writing tightly coupled code.  Yeah, I guess it does. Implementing design patterns is better than not.  It is true.  But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t learn the names. Yes, your customer cares about how fast you can get the project done.  But, that isn’t all they care about.</p>
<h2 id="The-Lies"><a href="#The-Lies" class="headerlink" title="The Lies"></a>The Lies</h2><p>Just because something takes longer while you are learning how to do it, doesn’t mean it will always take longer.  It probably took you a while to learn how to program proficiently too.  That didn’t stop you did it?  Does it take you as long to program now as when you first started?  Of course not! Let’s look at this from another angle.  As you’ve learned multiple languages, would you say that it made you a better or worse programmer?  Unless you have a very strange perspective, you will probably answer better.  Was the new language hard to learn?  Of course.  Did it take you longer to code using the new language than one you knew previously?  Of course.  Would you say the result of being proficient in both has made it easier or harder to code in both?  Easier, right? Tightly coupled code is easier to write, but as the application grows, tightly coupled code becomes harder to add to and harder to maintain.  It lends itself to code duplication and is more likely to be the code base that needs to be rewritten first. Tightly coupled code is also the hardest to tests and is probably the reason you don’t want to write test for your code.  Because you write tightly coupled code, testing is MUCH harder than it should be.  This leads you to have a firm belief that writing tests is hard as well.  A vicious cycle. And if you believe that tightly coupled code is a proper design, you will believe that tightly coupled code hinders design.  But in fact, writing tests will force you to write loosely coupled code.  So, instead of hindering design, it actually helps it. I used to think not learning the correct names for design patterns didn’t matter.  But the advantage of knowing the proper name for things is that we can all talk about something using the name rather than trying to explain what that thing is with lots of words.  It saves time.  But, there is another much more subtle reason why you need to learn the proper name for things.  You might be calling a design pattern you are using by an incorrect name and confusing the people you are communicating with.  And, finally, learning the names for all of the design patterns will expose you to design patterns you aren’t aware of, broadening your horizons. This last one is, or should be the most obvious.  Getting the project done quickly isn’t ALL your customer cares about.  It might be a relatively high priority, but I can assure you, if you explain to them that getting the project done as fast as possible will mean you have to rewrite the code if they want any changes, you’ll quickly find out that redoing work they’ve already paid for doesn’t sit well with them either.</p>
<h2 id="Benefits"><a href="#Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h2><p>It is a sad, sad truth that by convincing yourself that not investing in these best practices really is best for you and the clients you work for, you’ve also limited yourself to the quality of client you can work for.  The places that pay well expect you to know how to do this stuff.  They believe in good design.  They believe in testing.  They know how to implement design patterns. And guess what, these places also pay better too.  It raises you beyond the level of “commodity programmer” and into the level of “rare gem” How do I know? This past year I’ve been doing a lot of interviewing.  For various reasons, I decided to interview for jobs that pay 25% better than what I currently make.  In the beginning, I did this because I figured it would expose me to people more like myself who wanted to be better.  In the process, I discovered that the interview process is a little harder, but not impossible.  I figured out what I still need to learn.  And, I managed to beat my goal.  Time to notch it up a bit more.</p>
<h2 id="Are-You-Dead"><a href="#Are-You-Dead" class="headerlink" title="Are You Dead?"></a>Are You Dead?</h2><p>You hear stories all the time about people who can’t find work in our industry.  When you ask, you find out that all they know is something that was hot 10 years ago or longer.  Well, of course you can’t find a job.  And it is no wonder the last company got rid of you.  You provide no value. This past week I heard someone tell me the equivalent of, “I’m not going to learn anything new.  Every time I do, it ends up being hot for a few years and then it is gone.”  I was stunned.  I fear for this guy.  You might as well say, “I’m planning to retire in 10 years or less.” because that is what will happen to you.  Worse, if you stop learning completely, you could end up with dementia or worse. My plan is to program until I’m at least 75.  Longer if I stay healthy enough.  Even if I could retire, I won’t.  What would I do?  I love programming.  I love mentoring other programmers.  I love learning new stuff.</p>
<h2 id="Do-hard-stuff"><a href="#Do-hard-stuff" class="headerlink" title="Do hard stuff"></a>Do hard stuff</h2><p>And so what’s the point of all this?  Do hard stuff.  It will make you a better programmer.</p>

        <p>I’ve written about the technical interview before.  I’ve written both <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/3-reasons-responding-to-useless-interview-questions-makes-you-happier/">for</a> and <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/cracking-the-programmers-interview-code/">against</a> code interviews.  And I’ve provided both <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/7-c-interview-questions-that-weed-out-the-losers/">C#</a> and <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/7-javascript-interview-questions-to-weed-out-imposters/">JavaScript</a> questions to weed out fake programmers. But a little more experience under my belt has me rethinking what makes a good interview. Now, you may wonder why I think I’m particularly qualified to speak about the interview process.  Most people who have opinions about the interview process in particular have it from only one side.  The one of being the guy looking for a job.  And, most of you only interview when you need a job. What makes me qualified is that, I help interview people looking for a job and I interview for lots of jobs.  In my opinion, you should be interviewing for a job, even if you don’t need one, at least twice a year.  I interview more frequently than that.  In the last 6 months, I think I’ve interviewed at least 4 times. So, let me start by telling you what the current interview process looks like, and why it doesn’t work.  Then, I’ll move on to the few interviews that I believe captured the information everyone was looking for quickly and how you can move the conversation in this direction regardless of what side of the table you are sitting on.

<h2 id="The-Oral-Exam-Interview"><a href="#The-Oral-Exam-Interview" class="headerlink" title="The Oral Exam Interview"></a>The Oral Exam Interview</h2><p>I was part of a phone interview recently where every question we asked, the person who was answering the questions answered every question in such exquisite detail we were left thinking, “This guy is either REALLY smart, or he was reading something.”  We later gave him a coding interview where we were able to watch him solve the problem.  This revealed that he must have been reading something because the code interview revealed that he didn’t have any idea what he was talking about.  It wasn’t even a difficult interview. What this tells me is that all interviews that ask specific technical questions can do is tell you that the person you are interviewing can hack the technical interview.  Just like certifications, all you know is that they can take a test. In fact, we’ve actually hired some people who were able to even make it through a coding interview only to find out they couldn’t code. The obvious danger is that you could end up hiring someone who can’t really do the work because they were able to jump through your list of questions like some sort of trick pony. But there is an opposite danger. Just because someone can’t answer your questions, doesn’t mean they can’t do the work.</p>
<h2 id="The-Coding-Interview"><a href="#The-Coding-Interview" class="headerlink" title="The Coding Interview"></a>The Coding Interview</h2><p>As I’ve already hinted, the coding interview is no better.  Sometimes it will weed out the people who have no business interviewing, but it really tells you nothing other than, “have they used this technology before.” Unfortunately, I’m seeing a rise in this type of interview.  It will take a number of consistent failures before we start to see a decline. About 7 months ago, I was on the receiving end of a coding interview when I was asked to do some specific things while someone was watching.  I failed the interview because the specific things I was asked to do, I had not done yet even though I had written a full application using the tools the test was around. I’ve had other interviews where I was asked to code stuff that had no relation to the business I was being asked to interview for. So once again, you are just as likely to weed out a good person as you are to weed out a bad person.</p>
<h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>In both cases, the problem is the same.  You are asking questions that are way too specific.  Someone who is quick with the search engines can find you the answer you are looking for if they can hide the fact that they are doing it.  If you limit yourself to in person interviews, you limit who you can hire to people who live in the same geographic area. Even a video interview can hide the fact that the person interviewing is looking up the answers.  I know, I’ve seen it done. Even if you do a face to face, the answers you are looking for might be wrong or out of date. I was at an interview where I was asked how memory was managed in .NET.  Since I taught .NET for about 3.5 years at a training company and had actually taught this specific information, I was easily able to give them the information they were looking for.  But because I also listen to podcast, I was also able to amend the information with the fact that how it works in Windows is only how it works in Windows.  The spec doesn’t actually dictate how memory gets managed.  At least not at the level I think they wanted answered. But, what if they were looking for the answer that indicated that I knew how memory was managed under Windows and I gave the answer according to the spec?  Fail!</p>
<h2 id="A-Better-Way"><a href="#A-Better-Way" class="headerlink" title="A Better Way"></a>A Better Way</h2><p>One of the best interviews I ever had was when I was interviewing for a JavaScript position.  The question I was asked at the beginning of the interview way, “I know nothing about JavaScript, explain JavaScript to me.”  I started talking and occasionally, I would be asked to drill deeper into a subject.  It was a hard interview because it required me to break something down I was very familiar with, think on my feet, and demonstrate that I was able to explain things.  It also demonstrated how much of JavaScript I knew. As I’ve thought about that interview and compared it to others I have been on, what I realize is that this demonstrated that the person who was interviewing me really wanted to know what did I know.  In contrast, just about every oral exam interview I’ve been on has made me feel like the person interviewing me wanted to show me how much HE knew.</p>
<h2 id="The-Right-Questions-to-Ask"><a href="#The-Right-Questions-to-Ask" class="headerlink" title="The Right Questions to Ask"></a>The Right Questions to Ask</h2><p>So, if you want you can steal the question above.  But the point is, we want to ask open ended questions. “I see on your resume; you’ve worked with Angular.  What problems did you face while using that framework?” or “I see you have experience using Git and SubVersion.  What do you like and dislike about each?” or “Tell me about some of the issues your ran into with your last project.” In other words, ask very open ended questions around the technology you are interested in that invite them to demonstrate that they’ve really used the technology they say they have used.</p>
<h2 id="What-if-You-Are-the-One-Being-Interviewed"><a href="#What-if-You-Are-the-One-Being-Interviewed" class="headerlink" title="What if You Are the One Being Interviewed?"></a>What if You Are the One Being Interviewed?</h2><p>So, you walk into an interview and you are asked an oral exam question.  What do you do? Well, the first thing to do is to try to answer the stupid question (without reading of course.)  And then, and this is the key part because it will change the course of the interview, tell a story. Whatever they ask, the thing you want to do as soon as you possibly can, is to change the question into, “where have you used X in the past?” So, let’s take a JavaScript question.  “What does it mean that JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance.”  You answer the question, “prototypal inheritance means … in fact, knowing this became really important on one of my recent projects because we used it to do …” and you are off to the races.  When you finish demonstrating that you know the answer and it has been important to your work in the past, you might consider asking, “I was wondering, how has that been important to your work here?” Remember, your goal is convincing the people interviewing you that you really can do the work.  That hiring you compared to the other people they are going to interview is going to be 10 times less risky. Turning it all around like this is an art.  It takes practice.  This is why I encourage developers I coach to interview frequently.  Try stuff out.  Experiment.  When you get home, review what you were asked and think, “how could I answer that better the next time?”  Because, many of the questions we get asked get asked by everyone. If someone ask a question you don’t know the answer to, just say so.  My standard answer is, “I haven’t done much with that, but I’ve been programming for X years and there is Google, and <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/pluralsight">PluralSight</a>, how hard can it be?”  If you’ve never used it but have sniffed around the edges, say so.  An attitude of “I can do this.” works a lot better than lying about it. There are some other things you can do to hack the interview process, like sitting sideways, spreading your arms out, and other “hypnotic” tweaks.  But the best hack is spinning stories around your answers to change the interview from an exam into something more of a conversation.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I was asked this past week what my thoughts were on Angular 2.  I wrote early on about my impressions of Angular 2 when it was barely done enough to review.  But now that I’ve been working with it for a while and know a bit more, what I want to discuss is more along the line of what it means to the average developer and, more importantly, organizations that are planning to use it. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-3.png" alt="image" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Options"><a href="#Options" class="headerlink" title="Options"></a>Options</h2><p>While like Angular 1, Angular 2 provides us with most of what we need to build an application.  Angular 2 also provides us, out of the box, with very Angular 1 ish ways of of putting together an application, complete with modules.  What Angular 2 provides that isn’t quite so obvious going into your development is options. In angular 1, we had options at the GUI level.  And while this is still true for Angular 2, this is not the only place where you will see options. In general, you can split your options into, 1) do you want to do things the Angular 1 way, or 2) would you like to use an approach that looks more like React.JS?  No place is this more obvious than with how you deal with forms.  You can create forms with a declarative syntax, like you’ve done with Angular 1, using <a href="//angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html">Template Syntax</a>.  But, in my opinion, a much better way to create forms is with a more reactive approach using the FormControls and FormGroups classes.  If all you are doing is just displaying data, you’ll probably find that using the template syntax is all you need.  But once you start working with complex forms that accepts data input and implements validation, you’ll probably want to move toward a more reactive approach.  The added benefit is that more of you code will be testable. The next option you are going to have is figuring out how to move data around your system.  Most of the literature is going to suggest you use a data flow that looks a lot like what you were doing in Angular 1.  But there is nothing stopping you from using Flux, Redux, or even RxJS instead.  And here again, my recommendation would be that you learn these because I think you’ll find that your system will end up being much easier to reason about than the old MVVM stuff you may be used to.</p>
<h2 id="Lazy-Loading"><a href="#Lazy-Loading" class="headerlink" title="Lazy Loading"></a>Lazy Loading</h2><p>There are several places where we had to make choices in Angular 2 where the feature has been built into the framework.  One of these places is lazy loading.  Why load all of your JavaScript up front?  Load what you need when you need it.  Angular 2 makes this easy with Lazy Loading and the choice between using WebPack (the default) or System.JS. I’ll warn you though, as of this writing, Lazy Loading only really works when using System.JS unless you want to spend a lot of time tweaking your webpack config file.</p>
<h2 id="Angular-2-CLI"><a href="#Angular-2-CLI" class="headerlink" title="Angular 2 CLI"></a>Angular 2 CLI</h2><p>Command Line Interfaces seem to be the cool new kid on the block.  You aren’t a real framework unless you have one.  While the Angular CLI is not quite baked yet, I can see how this is going to make writing Angular 2 apps much easier.  There are a lot of moving parts involved in getting even the most basic of applications up and running.  The Angular CLI makes starting your first application REALLY easy.  It even hides all of the WebPack internals while allowing you to add your own config file if you need to.  Once they have the routing bit re-implemented, it should make using Lazy Loading with WebPack much easier. The other thing using the CLI will do for you is that you will automatically start following the <a href="//angular.io/styleguide">coding standards</a> that the Angular team have developed.</p>
<h2 id="Angular-2-Components"><a href="#Angular-2-Components" class="headerlink" title="Angular 2 Components"></a>Angular 2 Components</h2><p>Right now, there aren’t a lot of options available for Angular 2 for custom components.  While Kendo UI has been the defacto standard for Angular components in the past, Telerik is in the middle of rewriting <a href="//www.telerik.com/blogs/kendo-ui-for-angular-2-r3-roadmap">Kendo UI for Angular 2</a> (and React.JS).  I haven’t seen any movement in the Angular UI camp to support Angular 2.  Angular 2 Material has a few components that seem ready, but they are all relatively simple.  The only vendors that seems to have a complete Angular 2 package is <a href="//wijmo.com/angular2/">Wijmo</a> and <a href="//www.primefaces.org/primeng/">Prime Faces</a>.  I haven’t tried them and I’m not endorsing them.  I’m just reporting what I’ve found. There are a few standalone components here and there, but if you are looking for a set of components you can just use from one source, I’m afraid you’ll have to wait.  This isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  It gives you time to properly learn Angular 2. But what about the Angular 1 to Angular 2 bridge?  In my mind this is way more trouble than it is worth.  We’ve waited two years for Angular 2, I think we can wait just a bit longer for a set of components that we can use with it.</p>
<h2 id="What-Angular-2-Means-for-You"><a href="#What-Angular-2-Means-for-You" class="headerlink" title="What Angular 2 Means for You"></a>What Angular 2 Means for You</h2><p>The main difference between Angular 1 and Angular 2 is that just about any Script Kiddie could pick up Angular 1 and get something done.  Angular 1 was developed during a period of JavaScript history when JavaScript had not quite reach the level of “serious programming language.” But now, JavaScript has not just reached that level, but several very serious frameworks have been developed. What I notice as I review the JavaScript landscape is that we’ve moved from just getting stuff done with little to no planning, to treating JavaScript as a first class programming language that requires, and even demands that we adhere to a set of programming best practices that we would use for any other language.  These include things like naming conventions and design patterns.  For you to write code well in this new universe, you will need to understand what these design patterns are, why they exist and how to implement them well.  If you continue on your merry script kiddie way, you will soon find yourself out of work. Further, if you think you know Angular 2 just because you know Angular 1, or you think Angular 2 will be easy to pick up because you know Angular 1, you are in for a very big surprise.  Many of the concepts are the same.  But since Angular 2 has so many options, you should learn the options well so that you can make an educated decision about which option to use.</p>
<h2 id="What-Angular-2-Means-for-Organizations"><a href="#What-Angular-2-Means-for-Organizations" class="headerlink" title="What Angular 2 Means for Organizations"></a>What Angular 2 Means for Organizations</h2><p>Similarly, if you are an organization that is planning to move to Angular 2, don’t expect your programmers to just pick up and move to Angular 2 overnight.  Give them time to learn it.  My recommendation is that you make learning it part of their job while they continue to use Angular 1 for the product you are trying to complete.  We all have time pressure, so you need to factor learning into the schedule. But Angular 2 may also mean you need to find additional programmers who already have the skills and can transfer the knowledge to your team.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This past week I got into a small discussion about the importance of loosely coupled code.  Specifically, I was looking at event handler code that did nothing more than change the size of another element on the screen.  But the event handler code was in the controller which in the particular implementation we are using was the event handler portion of our Model in a MVVM architecture.  The question becomes does this code belong in the view, or does it belong in the controller? The question of where code belongs leads eventually to arguments for loosely coupled code.  If I put code in my controller that is manipulating the view, then I either need to mock out my view in order to test my controller or I have to have an instance of my view available to test my controller.  Having coded enough systems to know that both of those choices are problematic, I opt for placing the view specific code in the view.  Another place where you might place this code would be in a View Specific event handler class.  But that would only be for the purposes of clean separation.  Something we might consider doing if the View were plain HTML.  But in our particular case, the view is generated from code, so placing the handlers in that same code seems to be the most appropriate location for it. But all of this leads to a larger question.  Why should your code be loosely coupled at all? [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-2.png" alt="4 Reasons to Write Loosely Coupled Code" title="4 Reasons to Write Loosely Coupled Code"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/hernanpc/7115374283/">Hernan Piñera</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Refactoring"><a href="#Refactoring" class="headerlink" title="Refactoring"></a>Refactoring</h2><p>One of the main advantages of loosely coupled code is that this combined with granularity makes code refactoring easier.  Because my controller class only handles events that cause data to be manipulated and does not cause any changes to the view, I know that any changes I make to my controller will not cause any unexpected presentation layer changes. Similarly, and in this case, more importantly, any changes I make to the view will not force me to make changes to the controller class.  That is, all of the code that could be impacted by any one change happen in one and only one class. Loose coupling can also occur horizontally, and often does without us thinking too intensely about it.  Have you ever used a control from one vendor only to find another control works better?  The more easily those controls match each other’s programmable interface, the easier the job was to swap them out.  We can do the same type of thing in our own code.  The more granular the code is broken down; the easier any one part of the code can be replaced by something that works “better”.</p>
<h2 id="More-Maintainable"><a href="#More-Maintainable" class="headerlink" title="More Maintainable"></a>More Maintainable</h2><p>But the argument might be make that this is a lot of work for something that isn’t very likely to happen.  But anyone who has been programming more than a few years on essentially the same system knows that it does. Here’s how it looks.  You start out writing a system and you care very little about coupling or not.  Hey, we’ve got code to write and very little time.  Full steam ahead and forget best practices.  And for now, let’s assume you have a small enough system that you actually pull it off.  You get the system delivered, and somehow it miraculously works.  Congratulations. A few months go by and you get a new requirement or a change request comes in for an existing requirement.  Either way, you manage to shoe horn the change in. More time goes by and a change to the last set of changes comes in.  And now you realize that what you have is a rather fragile architecture that can’t possibly sustain the new request.  A change that might have taken a month given a more loosely coupled architecture is now going to take three because of the amount of rework that is going to be required. Another way that loosely coupled code helps is when you are writing a very large system.  Let’s say the system is large.  You write this for a few months and everything seems to be going fine when you hit that first, “oops! we forgot” moment.  So you have to go back and retro fit the change into your tightly coupled code.  And then you progress some more and hit even more of those kind of changes.  Eventually, everyone learns to hate this system because it is so hard to work on and every change we make to existing code causes more and more bugs.</p>
<h2 id="Cross-Platform"><a href="#Cross-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Cross Platform"></a>Cross Platform</h2><p>Refactoring and maintenance have some practical implications beyond just being able to work on your code.  In this world of multiple platforms, you may find yourself wanting to run some of what you’ve written on another platform.  There are multiple ways you might do this, but keeping your code isolated is going to make this easier.  Say you want to run your code on the web, as a desktop application, on the various mobile phones and tablets that are available.  Even if you do this all in the confines of HTML, JavaScript and CSS, you will most likely have different presentation layers.  If you have view specific code (to use our example again) that isn’t in the view, you’ll need to write code in the controller that detects which of the platforms you are running on. But if you’ve decided to use native components on each of the platforms, the view layer is actually going to change drastically.  And the view specific code you wrote might not even work on the new platform.  All the more reason to keep the view code isolated.</p>
<h2 id="Cross-Framework"><a href="#Cross-Framework" class="headerlink" title="Cross Framework"></a>Cross Framework</h2><p>Or, maybe you are going to upgrade your framework.  Angular 2 just released and it is drastically different from Angular 1.  I can tell you right now, the organizations who wrote loosely coupled Angular 1 code are going to have a much easier time transitioning to Angular 2.  Or maybe you want to switch from Angular to React, or from any of the multitude of frameworks to another.  The more loosely coupled your code, the easier it will be to move.  And nowhere is this more obvious than in the fast moving JavaScript world.</p>
<h2 id="Single-Responsibility"><a href="#Single-Responsibility" class="headerlink" title="Single Responsibility"></a>Single Responsibility</h2><p>Loosely coupled code is strongly related to the Single Responsibility principle.  You can’t have loosely coupled code unless the code follows the Single Responsibility principle.  And in the case above, putting view code in our controller actually violates both at the same time.  The controller is for manipulating view agnostic data.  The view is where your presentation layer code goes.  Of course, we could turn this around and remove the controller and put all of our code in the View.  Now that would definitely violate the single responsibility principle while giving the appearance of loose coupling.  But if we ever had to create multiple views we would quickly violate yet another principle.  Don’t Repeat Yourself.</p>
<h2 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing?"></a>Testing?</h2><p>Normally, I would lead off with testing.  But the argument could be made, “If I’m not going to write unit test, do I still need to do this?”  Actually, someone did make that argument.  And for now, ignoring that not writing unit test is a bad idea that I’ve written about before.  Writing unit test helps us think about these issues up front.  It isn’t that testing is the reason we write good code, although if that’s how you want to think about it I’m not going to stop you.  It is just that writing good test causes us to write good code.  Since it is the most visible benefit we tend to think of it first.  But testing isn’t at all why we do this.  We write test because it provides benefits much like loose coupling does.  Saying that we write loosely coupled code that follows the single responsibility principle so we can test would be like saying we don’t get lost so we can use our GPS.  It is the GPS that helps us to not get lost.  In the same way, it is the test that cause is to write good code.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Practices"><a href="#Best-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Best Practices"></a>Best Practices</h2><p>I know I’ve been following best practices for so long that I often forget why I’m doing them.  They work.  I do them.  But every once in a while, I need to step back and take a look at what I’m doing and ask “Why?” once again. What reasons can you think of for writing loosely coupled code?  Let me know in the comments.</p>

        <p>There have been a number of things that have occurred over the last week that have prompted this particular post.  And for anyone I work with, this is not an indictment of our work place so much as it is an indictment of our industry.  PLEASE don’t take this personally. Some of those reasons will show up in this article.  But the question we need to examine today is why is it so hard to write bug free code.  And I’m not even talking about perfection.  Why is it that we miss the simple stuff?  The stuff that once it is found, we think, “how could we have missed that?!”.  I’m perfectly aware that all code has bugs some just haven’t been found yet.  I’m also aware that no matter how hard I try, the stupid bugs always make their way past my desk.

<h2 id="No-Training"><a href="#No-Training" class="headerlink" title="No Training"></a>No Training</h2><p>Certainly not the only reason.  But at the same time I think this is a core reason.  Our industry really sucks when it comes to teaching computer science.  So much so, that I’ve written articles about how, for the most part, you don’t need a college education to become a programmer.  Maybe if we taught what programmers don’t already know how to do, a college education would be valuable. But what do we do instead?  We teach programmers how to program. Dumb! I think back to my education.  Here’s a basic summary of what I learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>COBOL, dBase III, JCS, CICS syntax.</li>
<li>Break your code into functions</li>
<li>A bit on how to do requirements analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guess what?  I could have learned all of that on my own.  How do I know that?  Because I had already taught myself, Basic and C before.  I taught myself every language I’ve learned since.  I was already writing structured code, and still do.  And how we gather requirements has changed and somehow I managed to learn that on my own.  Programming is a learning profession.  It is one of the things that makes it attractive to me. But what didn’t I learn?  At no point did anyone ever teach me how to break my own code.  And while Test Driven Development wasn’t a thing when I was going to school.  I doubt they are teaching it today.  (Let me know if your school did or is.)</p>
<h2 id="Happy-Path-Specs"><a href="#Happy-Path-Specs" class="headerlink" title="Happy Path Specs"></a>Happy Path Specs</h2><p>So, the programmers have no training.  But it isn’t just a programmer problem. When is the last time you got a specification from whoever creates them in your organization that had any more than a happy path set of requirements?  But, certainly there are things the system should not do.  I recently had to go asking for required fields and maximum field lengths in an application I was working on.  And that’s the simple stuff.</p>
<h2 id="Not-My-Job"><a href="#Not-My-Job" class="headerlink" title="Not My Job"></a>Not My Job</h2><p>If you have a QA department, you might be tempted to leave testing to QA.  My personal goal is to make sure QA doesn’t find anything.  At least, not something really obvious. But I know that some programmers get sloppy about testing their code if they know the safety net of QA exist. There is also the problem of QA believing they are the only ones who test.  Strange, but true.  When QA found out I was writing unit test for a pretty complex piece of logic, I was asked, “Then what will be left for me to do?!”  Strange but true. But what if we started working as teams?  For example, what if I could get QA to help me develop my test plan?  What if developing software was a WE activity instead of several silo developers each doing their own thing?</p>
<h2 id="Batch-Programming"><a href="#Batch-Programming" class="headerlink" title="Batch Programming"></a>Batch Programming</h2><p>This is one I really don’t understand.  But I know programmers who will write code for hours prior to running it.  Even if you did remember everything you coded, how can you possibly know where a bug is located if you wait that long?  You should be running your code every time you have something different that can be run so that you know what change caused a problem.  And don’t tell me you test every possible condition.  I know you don’t. Programmers who program like this are “Debbie Done” programmers. Why “Debbie Done”? There is this story about a programmer who used to work at one of the companies I worked at in the past.  She considered code done if it compiled and linked. I’m not as good at testing as I would like (yet) and I’m always embarrassed when someone finds a problem with my code.  So, I was shocked one day when I found out that a project manager wanted to give me some work because my code “always works.”  I knew that wasn’t true.  But when I reflected on what he was saying I realized that the difference in how I code and the other programmers he was comparing me to is that I write for a few minutes and then make sure that works before I continue on.</p>
<h2 id="We-Don’t-Plan-to-Test"><a href="#We-Don’t-Plan-to-Test" class="headerlink" title="We Don’t Plan to Test"></a>We Don’t Plan to Test</h2><p>Ah.  And here we get a little closer to the truth. What do I mean by planning to test? For any spec you are working on, you should have, written out or coded, a repeatable set of steps that ensures that your code does what it should and doesn’t do what it shouldn’t.  This is what test driven development attempts to steer us toward.  I’m not going to go off on a rant about TDD again here.  But I will tell you that either having a written out test plan prior to coding enables me to ensure that my code does what the people who gave me the specification think it should.  It also forces me to think about ways I might break the code.  I know my code is delivered with less bugs because of this process.  Hopefully, I’ll get better at thinking of how to break my own code. Having a plan helps with the Debbie Done programmer as well as people who code more like me. Even though I code/test incrementally, I still only test the code right after I’ve written it.  Once I think it is working, I don’t go back, even though something else I’ve written may have changed how the code is working.  Having repeatable tests has save me several times.</p>
<h2 id="We-Don’t-Know-what-we-Don’t-Know"><a href="#We-Don’t-Know-what-we-Don’t-Know" class="headerlink" title="We Don’t Know what we Don’t Know"></a>We Don’t Know what we Don’t Know</h2><p>Even if we do everything right, we are still going to miss stuff.  One person can’t possibly figure out all that might go wrong.  It is how we deal with the problems once they are revealed that becomes the issue.  This is where we would, ideally, have the team come up with the test scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="Shame-Driven-Development"><a href="#Shame-Driven-Development" class="headerlink" title="Shame Driven Development"></a>Shame Driven Development</h2><p>I actually heard a project manager say, “Shame on the developer if QA finds bugs.” Really?!  What about “Shame on the BA for not including that item in the requirements.”?  What about “Shame on the product owner for not mentioning it.”? Or what about no shame at all? While shame is a powerful motivator in the short term, it is a sure way to make sure your developers leave. That you only retain highly dysfunctional programmers.  Or that you can only retain programmers who can’t really code. Shame based development can only lead to even more bugs.  Not fewer. At some point I should probably write about the dangers of a shame based culture.   If your organization is using shame to manage personnel.  Get out!</p>
<h2 id="Long-Hours"><a href="#Long-Hours" class="headerlink" title="Long Hours"></a>Long Hours</h2><p>Another way you can kill the overall effectiveness of your team is to make sure everyone works more than 45 hours a week for months or years at a time.  One of two things will happen, if not both. The code will suffer.  Want to introduce more bugs?  Keep everyone working overtime.  A week here or there is a different story. If the code doesn’t suffer, then you are likely to find a lot more socialization, social media activities, and just plain goofing off occurring.  People just can’t work that many hours.  Just because someone is at work for 10 hours doesn’t mean they are working 10 hours.  But hours are easy to measure, so this terrible practice continues.</p>
<h2 id="We-Can’t-Fix-Everything"><a href="#We-Can’t-Fix-Everything" class="headerlink" title="We Can’t Fix Everything"></a>We Can’t Fix Everything</h2><p>I’m in a unique position in that I’m currently functioning as a Scrum coach.  This allows me to influence all the areas I’ve discussed.  As programmers, you can only influence your own stuff.  So, my recommendation to you is to concentrate on what you have control over.  Create a test plan prior to writing code.  Once you’ve learned how to do that, work on learning how to code those test so you don’t have to run them manually over and over again.  Do this slowly.  Maybe start with just one test.  Squeeze it into the cracks of your regular work.  Learning to test and learning to code test takes time, but it will make you a better programmer and will ultimately make you a more reliable and faster programmer.  Someday you might just hear that they want to give you an important job because “Johnny’s code always works.”</p>

        <p>Have you ever noticed how, when QA reports a “defect” developers tend to bristle?  I first noticed this in myself a few years ago.  Now that I’m functioning as a Scrum coach, I’m noticing it in others. Is there a way to have some kind of quality checking in our code that doesn’t make the whole process feel so adversarial?  I think so. I believe there are some adjustments that need to be made organizationally and personally that will bring these two groups together. But first, why does this problem exist in the first place?

<h2 id="How-The-Battle-Started"><a href="#How-The-Battle-Started" class="headerlink" title="How The Battle Started"></a>How The Battle Started</h2><h3 id="How-to-Insult-a-Programmer"><a href="#How-to-Insult-a-Programmer" class="headerlink" title="How to Insult a Programmer"></a>How to Insult a Programmer</h3><p>When I was growing up, my sister was very direct.  If she thought you were ugly, she’d tell you so.  OK.  Maybe it wasn’t quite that bad.  But one day, I remember she said something to the effect of, “I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true.”  And both my mom and I said, “Yes, but it isn’t what you said so much as how you said it.”  In fact, you can say the same words in two entirely different ways.  Two sets of inflections.  And what they mean can change drastically.  Sometimes just changing the words you use can change the meaning. But, to a programmer, no matter how you say, “Your code has a bug,” they will probably end up hearing. “Your code sucks!” You see.  Programmers really do care about their code.  At least the really good ones do.  And while it may seem very silly, most programmers get offended when you suggest they’ve written buggy code. This, you see, is the core of the problem.  Once you understand this, the fix becomes rather obvious.</p>
<h3 id="Don’t-Call-It-a-Bug"><a href="#Don’t-Call-It-a-Bug" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Call It a Bug"></a>Don’t Call It a Bug</h3><p>I think nothing has done more damage in the field of programming that the fact that we call software problems “Bugs.”  It is such an ugly word.  When is the last time, other than a Pixar movie, when we’ve thought of bugs as something we would want to welcome?  We might as well say, “Hey, I found some shit in this program!” When I got my Scrum certification, our instructor asked a simple revealing question.  “How many of you think people are doing their best to do the right thing?”  That’s not exactly what he asked, but that’s what he meant.  If you believe that all evil in the world is intentional, you’ll come away believing that all programmer intentionally put bugs in their code.  And while I do know of a few cases where this has happened.  Most of us try our best to write perfect code.  When we don’t it is because we didn’t think of the situation and code for it. If on the other hand, you think everyone is trying to do their best, why treat defects in software as something evil? To paraphrase Scott Hanselman, “Most people are not nearly smart enough to be as evil as you act like they are.”</p>
<h3 id="Most-Bugs-are-a-Specification-Problem"><a href="#Most-Bugs-are-a-Specification-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Most Bugs are a Specification Problem"></a>Most Bugs are a Specification Problem</h3><p>Weather you have a formal specification or an informal specification, my observation is that most “Bugs” that show up in code are a result of either 1) the specification being misunderstood or 2) the specification being incomplete. Yes, there are a few places where neither of those are true and the programmer clearly missed the mark.  But, even then, assuming they missed the mark rather than assuming the specification was unclear will go a long way in making the programmer more receptive to the fact that the code needs to be changed.  Just the fact that we call a defect in our programs a “Bug” reveals and colors what we think about who’s fault</p>
<h2 id="What-Programmers-Can-Do"><a href="#What-Programmers-Can-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Programmers Can Do"></a>What Programmers Can Do</h2><h3 id="It’s-Not-Personal"><a href="#It’s-Not-Personal" class="headerlink" title="It’s Not Personal"></a>It’s Not Personal</h3><p>Listen gang.  Bugs are not a reflection of your personal character.  And even if someone thought it was, that doesn’t make it true.  At worse, it means you might have some stuff you still need to learn about how to program well.  OK.  We’ll never be perfect.  Think about this, while you are writing the code, your compiler, or runtime, tells you you’ve done something wrong quite frequently.  But as soon as a human tells you something similar, you take it personally?  That’s pretty wacked. Here are a few tips I’ve learned.</p>
<ul>
<li>Emotions are learned responses.  This means your negative response to bugs can be retrained.</li>
<li>Just because someone says something about you, or disapproves of you personally, doesn’t mean they are right.</li>
<li>Most criticism is only an opinion based on an expectation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can internalize these, you will be much more receptive to hearing that your code has a flaw.</p>
<h3 id="Break-the-Spec-into-Tasks"><a href="#Break-the-Spec-into-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="Break the Spec into Tasks"></a>Break the Spec into Tasks</h3><p>One thing I’ve started doing recently that I’ve found to be a great help is that I’ve started breaking the specification I’ve been given down into the composite task that I’ll need to implement the specification.  How granular.  I aim for task that should take less than four hours.  By getting this granular, I’m able to accurately estimate how long it should take me to complete the specification, and I’m sure I’ve caught all of the tasks involved in completing the specification. You should track your time against your estimates so you can get a sense of how far off your gut is relative to reality.  This will improve your ability to estimate projects. By breaking down the project like this, you are more likely to see holes in the requirements before you even start coding.</p>
<h3 id="Create-a-Test-Plan"><a href="#Create-a-Test-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Create a Test Plan"></a>Create a Test Plan</h3><p>The other thing I’ve started doing is that I’ve started writing out how I plan to test the specification once I’ve completed it.  I just write this out.  Once again, this helps me find holes in the requirement.  But this also forces me to start thinking of ways someone might use the code that would break it.  And that simple act of trying to break it in my mind prior to coding it, refines the spec, and makes my code more reliable.</p>
<h3 id="Ask-for-a-Review"><a href="#Ask-for-a-Review" class="headerlink" title="Ask for a Review"></a>Ask for a Review</h3><p>Once you have your tasks and your test plan, ask the person who gave you the spec to review it.  “Does this look like it reflects what you’ve asked me to do?”  This does two things.  First, and most importantly, it ensures you understand what it is you are building.  But, it also enlists someone else in the responsibility of ensuring what you finally build is what should have been built.</p>
<h2 id="What-QA-Can-Do"><a href="#What-QA-Can-Do" class="headerlink" title="What QA Can Do"></a>What QA Can Do</h2><h3 id="Don’t-Call-Them-Bugs"><a href="#Don’t-Call-Them-Bugs" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Call Them Bugs"></a>Don’t Call Them Bugs</h3><p>I remember reading a Louis L’amour book one where the basic plot was this wagon train going out west.  At the beginning of the trip they had all agreed that no “bad language” was allowed.  And then one day, someone used the word, “shit” to describe cow poop that was on the ground.  The group was in shock and he was reprimanded.  At that point I remember the line, “If a word makes it any different, why don’t we just call it pudding?” But you see, as I’ve already explained, a word DOES make a difference. The word I would prefer to use is “Specification Refinement” because, in the end, that is what they are.</p>
<h3 id="Don’t-Write-Requirements"><a href="#Don’t-Write-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Write Requirements"></a>Don’t Write Requirements</h3><p>One thing I’ve noticed happens quite frequently is that once QA has verified all of the items in the requirement, they start doing exploratory testing, as they should.  But, when they find something, they inadvertently start writing requirements.  It looks like this. “I did X, Y and Z.  I expected to get result 1 but instead got result 2.” Some of you are probably thinking, “What’s wrong with this?!” Well, why did you EXPECT to get result 1?  If the expectation was not listed in the requirement, you have no valid reason to expect anything.  Your expectation is just your opinion about what should happen based on previous experience. So, how to write up this problem instead? “I did X, Y and Z and 2 happened.  This doesn’t look right but I don’t see anything in the spec that says what should happen.”</p>
<h3 id="Don’t-Assign-Bugs"><a href="#Don’t-Assign-Bugs" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Assign Bugs"></a>Don’t Assign Bugs</h3><p>This one is going to fly in the face of QA teams everywhere.  But remember, we are trying to find peace in what has become an antagonistic relationship. Remember how I said that programmers react emotionally to the fact that you found a bug?  Well, if you assign a bug to them and they get a notification about that bug in the middle of writing code for the current sprint, here is what is going to happen.  First, the email is going to interrupt them.  Second, they will have an emotional response to the bug report that could continue to derail them for the rest of the day. Instead, you should be assigning the bug to the project.  Assuming you are using Scrum and have a backlog, the issue should be put on the backlog for grooming.  Grooming would include figuring out who is responsible for the bug or who is responsible for finding out what the core issue is so we can assign the bug appropriately. One of the problems I’ve seen with assigning bugs to specific developers is that the bug is often assigned incorrectly. By assigning the bugs to the back log as specification refinements, they just become additional features and the sting associated with “Bugs” goes away. If you are using software that requires you to assign bugs to an individual, make that individual the Scrum Master, Product Owner, or Project Manager (if you aren’t doing Scrum).</p>
<h2 id="Organizational-Changes"><a href="#Organizational-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Organizational Changes"></a>Organizational Changes</h2><p>Finally, I want to address organizational changes that you may need to make.  Hopefully, you are already doing this.  But my experience tells me otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="Silos-Kill"><a href="#Silos-Kill" class="headerlink" title="Silos Kill"></a>Silos Kill</h3><p>Everywhere I go, QA is a separate department.  Why can’t QA be co-located with the developers?  Wouldn’t it make a lot more sense to have QA working with the developers to figure out a test plan so we can code for the plan rather than having the plan developed in isolation?  I get that exploratory testing might reveal additional issues, but certainly some of those issues can be revealed early by defining how the code is going to be explored.  Plus, making everyone part of the same team means they are all working toward the same goal.  No one gets offended that way. When one QA person found out I was writing unit tests, she asked, “What will be left for me to tests?”  Which I found to be an incredibly naïve way of thinking.  Wouldn’t you hope that you don’t find any problems with the code I am working on?  How is the fact that I’m testing a problem for QA?  Aren’t we all working on the same goal?</p>
<h3 id="Central-Source-of-Truth"><a href="#Central-Source-of-Truth" class="headerlink" title="Central Source of Truth"></a>Central Source of Truth</h3><p>Another place that needs to be addressed related to silos – Another area that re-enforces and is a result of silos – is this habit of each group using their own project management software. In one organization I’ve worked at we used four different systems.  One system for version control (GitHub) another system for QA (HP Quality Center) a third system to manage requirements (which we only used minimally and instead had documents on a shared drive) and a forth system for managing our Kanban board (Jira). The frustrating thing is that 80% of what everyone needed to do could have been achieved by using GitHub.  But even if we needed to use separate systems for the actual artifacts, it seems to me that we could use one system for tracking the project instead of having it tracked three or four different ways.  That’s just craziness.</p>

        <p>We’ve all been there.  Either at the micro level or at the macro level.  Business wants to know, “How much is this going to cost me?”  And as software developers, we all know the answer is, “more than you were expecting.”  We also know that whatever number we give will probably be wrong for a number of reasons.  Chief among them is that no one really knows what they want until they see it. And yet, there has to be some way of providing business what they need and still allowing for unknowns. So what follows are a few tips on estimating that help you estimate software projects like a pro. [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/image-2.png" alt="How to Estimate Software Projects Like a Pro" title="How to Estimate Software Projects Like a Pro"> Photo via <a href="//visualhunt.com/photos/business/">Visualhunt</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="You-Don’t-Know-What-You-Don’t-Know"><a href="#You-Don’t-Know-What-You-Don’t-Know" class="headerlink" title="You Don’t Know What You Don’t Know"></a>You Don’t Know What You Don’t Know</h2><p>This tends to be the most famous argument for not giving an estimate.  Or for giving an estimate that is all but meaningless. “My gut says this will take a month, so I’m going to say four months because I really have no idea.” Well, that might be a safe estimate, and you might be right.  But if the business is looking for a number to use for a budget, they are going to learn that you pad your estimates.  So, a better answer is, “Are you looking for a rough ballpark or are you basing your budget on this?” And if they say they need a somewhat accurate number, your answer should be, “I really don’t know enough about the project.  Could we break it down into its component parts?</p>
<h2 id="Virtually-Walk-Through-the-Project"><a href="#Virtually-Walk-Through-the-Project" class="headerlink" title="Virtually Walk Through the Project"></a>Virtually Walk Through the Project</h2><p>This will work regardless of the project size and regardless of if it is just you or a team. Here’s what you need to do, once you’ve broken the project down into the component parts, ask yourself, “What is the next thing I would need to do to get this project moving?”  You write that down, come up with an estimate for how long that will take, and then ask yourself the question, “Assuming I’ve completed what I’ve listed so far, what is the next thing I need to do?”  And you just keep doing this until the project is (virtually) done. You want to be careful as you are doing this to:</p>

<li>For estimating actual work at the programming level, make sure none of your tasks take more than 8 hours to complete.  I personally aim for 4 hours.  Even if you use story points instead of actual hours, I’m sure internally you have some idea of how many hours a story point represents for you.  Size the work accordingly.</li>
<li>For estimating at the more macro level, I recommend dividing the project into 2-man week chunks.  Basically a sprint.</li>
<li><p>Don’t forget the obvious</p>
</li>
<li><p>Setup time</p>
</li>
<li>Creating tests.</li>
<li>Bug fix time.</li>
<li>Broken dependencies</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Everything-takes-twice-as-long-as-you-think-it-will"><a href="#Everything-takes-twice-as-long-as-you-think-it-will" class="headerlink" title="Everything takes twice as long as you think it will."></a>Everything takes twice as long as you think it will.</h2><p>This rule of thumb has served me well over the years.  But it isn’t a hard and fast rule.  It often depends on the client.  I switch clients frequently because I am a contract programmer.  If I’m new, I’ll provide estimates with the 2x multiple factored in.  But as I learn more about the people providing the requirements, I’ll tweak that factor appropriately. I had one product owner I worked with who I learned to provide a multiple of four to because I only heard half of what he was trying to communicate.  I’m not sure where the communication breakdown was, all I know is if I multiplied by four, I was much better at being able to manage his expectations.</p>
<h2 id="Track-Everything"><a href="#Track-Everything" class="headerlink" title="Track Everything"></a>Track Everything</h2><p>Even if you implemented everything I’ve recommended, you are still likely to fail in the long term because you’ll never learn from your mistakes. So what might you track?  Well, at the personal level, you want to track how close your estimate was to reality.  Over time you’ll learn that you tend to be off by so much.  And as you learn to estimate and track, I would expect your estimates to account for more items so that your multiple gets closer to a factor of 1x than the 2x I recommended you to start with. At the more macro level, you want to track the team.  Please, don’t track individuals.  Let the individuals do that.  Provide training so they can get better.  But if you do the tracking for them, you’ll destroy moral. But you want to know, when the team says they can do X in a week, that probably means it is going to take a week and a half… or whatever it ends up taking. I’m working on a project now where, had I been the project manager, I would have doubled all the estimates I was given.  Oh well, they’ll find out soon enough.  Although I would have expected this particular PM to know better. You also want to track items you may have forgotten to put in your plan.  You’ll add this to your “estimation checklist” which I’ll discuss next.</p>
<h2 id="Estimation-Checklist"><a href="#Estimation-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Estimation Checklist"></a>Estimation Checklist</h2><p>You want to create a checklist that you can use to make sure you’ve covered everything that needs to be estimated.  Along with the items I included above, here are some others you might want to include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Database Refresh side effects – yes I know, each programmer SHOULD have their own copy of the database, but I’ve yet to work for an organization that does this.  Because we don’t have this on my current project, we’ve lost valuable morning time twice this week waiting for the database we are using to get updated.  At least we aren’t all working against the production database.</li>
<li>Version Control Management – this includes branching, merging, pull request, and code reviews.</li>
<li>Holidays and Vacations</li>
<li>Any learning curves that must be mastered.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Management-Doesn’t-Like-the-Estimate"><a href="#Management-Doesn’t-Like-the-Estimate" class="headerlink" title="Management Doesn’t Like the Estimate"></a>Management Doesn’t Like the Estimate</h2><p>There have been a few times when the manager I’m working for doesn’t like the estimate I provide.  In my experience there are several reasons for this. First, and almost always, if I’m right, the project is going to take a lot longer than they expected, or longer than they’ve been told to do it in. Second, they are used to estimates that are half as long.  The problem isn’t that my estimates are wrong, but that their expectations have been set lower. What to do? Well, I take them to my list and show them where all the time is.  Because I can document where the time is going to be spent, I rarely have to do more than explain how I came to the estimate I did. If they still bulk, I simply have this conversation, me: “So, you think my estimates are high?” them: (yes). me: “Do your other programmers write tests for their code?” them: (no) me: “When you compare their time to the time I’ve said I’m going to take, do you account for bug fixes?” them: (no) me: “If you did account for the bug fixes, would their estimates be more or less accurate?” them: (less) me: “Do you believe the way I’ve proposed to complete this project will result in less bugs than you normally see?” Well, you get the point.  I’ve yet to have to have a conversation that went into that much detail.  And the more you track, the easier this conversation becomes because you can just say, “I’ve been tracking my estimates against reality now for N years and I’ve found that I normally am within X% of my estimate.</p>
<h2 id="Tools"><a href="#Tools" class="headerlink" title="Tools"></a>Tools</h2><p>There are a couple of tools I really like for estimating.  The first one is the Mind Map.  If you aren’t familiar with Mind Mapping, it is a way of just getting your ideas down on paper without having to worry about the structure or the order.  All you concentrate on is relationships.  This is a great way of breaking a project down into the smallest possible units of work. Once you have a mind map of your tasks, you can put the individual tasks into a Kanban Board.  You want a board that can provide the ability to attach estimates to the tasks and will show you a burn down/up chart based on how much work you’ve completed. For Mind Mapping, I currently use <a href="//www.mindmup.com">Mind Mup</a>. For Kanban, I use <a href="//trello.com/">Trello</a> with <a href="//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plus-for-trello-time-trac/gjjpophepkbhejnglcmkdnncmaanojkf?hl=en">Plus For Trello</a>. I wish there was a tool that married the two ideas.  That way I could use Mind Mapping for Epics, Stories, and defining tasks and I could use a Kanban board for tracking work.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Over the last week, I’ve been helping other programmers estimate the task they’ve been assigned and this has caused me to reflect on how I estimate software.  What works.  What doesn’t.  What mistakes I see people make. There has also been a move to avoid estimates entirely.  The argument goes something along the lines of, “we know the least about a project at the beginning of the project, so we can’t really give an accurate estimate.”  Which is mostly true.  And yet, there are people who need to know “how much is this going to cost?”  What do we do for them?  How do we balance the two realities? And then all of this lead me to think of all the ways we sabotage our estimates, or our estimates are sabotaged for us. You might think that estimating projects only applies to project managers.  But the truth is, most places I have worked rely on programmers to give them estimates, and frankly, most of us screw this up. [caption id=”” align=”alignnone” width=”640”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/image-1.png" alt="How to Sabotage Estimates" title="How to Sabotage Estimates"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/museemccordmuseum/2918567169/">Musée McCord Museum</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com/photos/people/">Visual hunt</a> / <a href="//flickr.com/commons/usage/">No known copyright restrictions</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Working-Backwards-from-a-Date"><a href="#Working-Backwards-from-a-Date" class="headerlink" title="Working Backwards from a Date"></a>Working Backwards from a Date</h2><p>This is the most obvious, I think, so we’ll get it out of the way first.  But it has some permutations that aren’t quite so obvious that we need to examine as well. Now, I get it.  There are some cases where there is a specific end date.  Something that is out of your control is happening on a specific date.  If you don’t deliver the software by that time, then you might as well not create it.  But, in that case, you have to take the golden triangle into consideration.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can have it on a specific date.</li>
<li>You can do it all.</li>
<li>You can do it within budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, even each of these have limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might be able to release something on a specific date, but it may not be all that was intended.</li>
<li>Even if you could buy all of the resources you needed, which is hardly ever possible, there will be limitations to using all of the resources.</li>
<li>If you have a limited budget, doing it all will probably suffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where using Scrum has a huge advantage.  Because at least using Scrum, you are constantly picking the next most valuable feature to implement and each feature is released in a potentially deliverable state.  This is quite unlike the project I’m working on where components are being worked on that we can’t even really test because they get called by something that has yet to be built.  Grant it, they’ll eventually be needed to have a viable product, but it is really hard to argue they are the NEXT most valuable feature when they can’t even be tested. Now, if you are working backward from a date, this could work if you add more resources, or you cut features.  I’ve worked in some organizations that were really good about figuring out what could be done and making sure the client was on board with the fact that we would only deliver that much.  But there have been other organizations where every time I suggested we not deliver a feature, I’ve been given a hundred reasons why that couldn’t be done.  Needless to say, those projects are doomed. Working backwards from a date is largely a management issue or a client issue.  But as they ask programmers for dates in light of the date, I find programmers are inclined to try to give numbers they think their managers want to hear rather than what they expect can really be done.</p>
<h2 id="Going-with-Your-Gut"><a href="#Going-with-Your-Gut" class="headerlink" title="Going with Your Gut"></a>Going with Your Gut</h2><p>The next most dangerous way of providing an estimate is to just go with your gut feel.  Here’s the thing about your gut.  It’s pretty optimistic. I find that everything takes about twice as long as I think it will.  I’ve worked for some people who I quickly learned were only describing half of the project.  In those cases, I’d be off by a factor of four. So, I’ve learned to compensate.  Whenever I’m asked for a “rough estimate” I always double whatever my gut thinks.  In some cases, I’ll pad even more. But the right thing to do would be to spend a few hours and break the project down into task that take less than a day.  Ideally you want to break those tasks down into half day sized tasks.  Once you have all of the tasks spelled out, you can add up the hours and you’ll have a pretty good idea of just how long the project will take you. If you are working in an office, don’t forget to account for meetings, helping others, and other tasks that tend to happen over the course of a week when you provide the date you plan to be done.  Otherwise, you’ll find you’ll end up having gotten the hours right but still end up being late. How do you break the plan down?  What I do is I ask a very obvious questions.  What’s the next thing I would need to do? Let’s assume we are starting a new feature.  If you were to sit down and code that feature right now, what is the next thing you’d have to do to code that feature?  It might be, “setup the programming environment” or “setup version control” or “get a test harness in place” or “create a branch from version control” it doesn’t matter that it might take a half an hour to do.   That’s actually good.  Just don’t let it be so big of a task that it is going to take you several days to complete. Next, assuming you’ve done the tasks so far, what is the next thing you’ll need to do. You just keep doing this until you have a set of task that fit within the half day sized and all fully describe the steps you will take to get the project done.  While breaking task down this way will get you a much more accurate number, I’ve found that I still need to double the time I think it will take.  Especially if I know little or nothing about the project I’m getting in to.  The more you learn about the project, the less padding you should need to do.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Plan-for-the-Unknown"><a href="#Don’t-Plan-for-the-Unknown" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Plan for the Unknown"></a>Don’t Plan for the Unknown</h2><p>But in every project, there will still be some unknowns.  In fact, this past week, I hit one of those.  When I put it on my task list, I put it in as 8 hours figuring there would probably be some refactoring I’d need to do.  But when I got to it, what I found was that the refactoring project was a lot bigger than I had expected. In this case, the best thing to do is to raise this new information to the team and adjust your estimate based on the new information. At the end of the day, I don’t expect this will actually impact my delivery date because some of my other task are going faster than I was expecting, but I’m still adjusting my estimates to document the fact that it had to be done.</p>
<h2 id="Forget-Who-Is-Asking"><a href="#Forget-Who-Is-Asking" class="headerlink" title="Forget Who Is Asking"></a>Forget Who Is Asking</h2><p>Most people I work for give me pretty accurate descriptions of the problem I’m going to work on.  I can safely double the amount of time I think it will take and I generally hit my dates. But occasionally, there is that client who only tells you half of what he’s actually thinking.  You’ll learn who that is in your life soon enough.  You can either complain that you didn’t get complete enough requirements.  Or you can plan on the requirements being incomplete and pad your estimates accordingly. Telling your client or manager (who is your client in most cases) that they did it wrong, may not be the most prudent way of dealing with this issue.  I opt for padding the estimates.</p>
<h2 id="Working-from-a-Summary"><a href="#Working-from-a-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Working from a Summary"></a>Working from a Summary</h2><p>This kind of gets back to the last two points, but it needs to be called out separately. You see, most of the time you’ll be asked for an estimate with enough information to make the call.  But there are other times all you’ll have is a working summary.  I find it best in this case to give the person asking for the estimate such a wide estimate (1 – 8 hours) that it is worthless for anything other than a rough ballpark idea of how much effort the project will take and explain that I would need more information to give a better estimate. Most people are pretty understanding when you explain this correctly.  Whatever you do, don’t give a fixed number that you can’t adjust up and down as you discover more information.  In fact, even when you have more information, you should always give your estimates in terms of ranges of time.</p>
<h2 id="Assume-it-Will-Work"><a href="#Assume-it-Will-Work" class="headerlink" title="Assume it Will Work"></a>Assume it Will Work</h2><p>Even the seasoned programmers make this mistake.  I know one guy who brags about how quickly he can write the code.  But he completely ignores the fact that while he spent a month writing the code, he’s spent three months getting it past the QA department.  So, did he really get the project done it a month?  Oh and those bugs?  God help you if you suggest those bugs are HIS fault! But, I find we all tend to do this in some way or another. All I want to say about this here is this.  You can either plan to test your code using some sort of test framework or you need to plan to fix bugs.  Which you plan for is up to you, but those of you who have followed my blog know I’m going to tell you that you’ll save a lot of time if you plan to write and execute tests.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I’m sure many of you could have written a post like this.  So, I invite you to add to it in the comments below.</p>

        <p>I’ve written about <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/tag/selenium/">using Selenium to test web applications before</a>.  But all of those articles have assumed you are using C#.  I’ve realized that Selenium has multiple language bindings which allow me to use any language I want but C# just seemed easier at the time.  But, now I’m in an environment that doesn’t use .NET at all.  They use Java.  I know Java, but I choose not to use it and instead my focus at this shop is all JavaScript.  Which means, if I want to write Selenium tests to verify my work, I need to write my tests in JavaScript.  But Using JavaScript to Drive Selenium is, in my opinion what everyone should be doing.  At least everyone who is writing most of their web application using client side code. Think about it, the primary language you wrote the client side with is JavaScript, and yet you are going to write your tests using C#, Java, PHP… when you could be writing the tests using JavaScript.  The same language you used to write the bulk of your application.  Further, when you write your tests using C# or Java, you’ll probably either write the tests using a unit testing framework (MSTest, NUnit, JUnit) or you’ll use some sort of BDD adapter like SpecFlow to coerce the unit testing framework into the behavioral pattern you need. <img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/image.png" alt="image" title="image">  If, you use JavaScript, you can use Jasmine, which is already behavioral, to run your tests. Another added advantage to the binding I’m going to recommend in this post, is that you get parallelization right out of the box.  You don’t need to write any funky code to <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/running-selenium-in-parallel-with-any-net-unit-testing-tool/">make your tests run in parallel</a>.  You get that for free. Another advantage I see for large companies is that not every group is going to be using the same server side language.  Where I’m at there are several groups using .NET and several groups using Java.  But everyone is using JavaScript.  If we all use JavaScript to drive our Selenium tests, we can share the knowledge we learn with other groups. So, let’s get started. For the purposes of this article, I’m going to assume you’ve already <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/you-can-start-using-node-today/">setup your node environment using the instructions I provided a couple of weeks ago</a>.  If you haven’t, you should do that now.  If you already have Node setup on your computer, but you are still using a version less that 6.3, I’m going to suggest you upgrade to the current version so that you can use some of the new ES2015 functionality like fat arrows.</p>
<h2 id="Setup"><a href="#Setup" class="headerlink" title="Setup"></a>Setup</h2><p>The tools we are going to use for testing using JavaScript, other than Node are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//webdriver.io/">WebDriver.io</a></li>
<li><a href="//webdriver.io/guide/reporters/spec.html">WebDriver.io Spec Reporter</a></li>
<li><a href="//jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And while the documentation on the WebDriver.IO site is quite complete, you would need to wade through quite a bit of information you don’t need to get this all setup and going.  We are going to give you just enough to get started.  If you want more information, I invite you to visit the website I’ve linked to above. For the purposes of this walk through, we are going to ignore the Selenium Grid part.  I’ve written about setting up Selenium Grid before.  Using the grid from WebDriver.io will just be a matter of changing some configurations.  Similarly, if you want to run the test from a cloud provider, the docs for that are on the website. Here, we are just going to get setup with a standalone server.  This suits my typical use of Selenium is to write a test for one specific tests at a time.  Once I have it working, I disable the tests.  The only time I run all of my test is prior to deploying the code to DEV just to make sure I didn’t break anything along the way.  Besides, setting up a standalone environment gets you started quickly. Before we really get started with the JavaScript stuff, make sure you have Java installed on your computer.  You’ll need that to run the Selenium stuff. So, to start out, install WebDriver.io First create a project directory for your new test project.  You can, of course, name it whatever you want.  Just make sure you make that directory your current working directory (CD into it.) Once you’re in the project directory, create your package.json file by typing in npm init Which will ask you several questions about your project.  Answer the questions and/or accept the defaults. Then install WebDriver.io by using the NPM command <code>npm install webdriverio --save-dev</code> This should place wdio in your ./node_modules/.bin directory.  Run <code>./node_modules/.bin/wdio --help</code> To verify that it is working.  If you are running on a Windows computer, you’ll want to make those forward slashes back slashes. Now that it is working, we are going to use it to configure a test runner file.  Type in ./node_module/.bin/wdio config One of the questions it is going to ask is which framework you want to use.  Pick ‘Jasmine’ Then it will ask if it should install the framework for you, pick ‘Yes’ Then it will ask where your tests are located.  Type in the correct location. Then it will ask which adapter you want to use.  Pick ‘spec’ and have it install that library for you. For Service, select ‘selenium-standalone’ and let it install that for you as well.  (Noticing a theme here?) For base URL, pick <a href="//www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a> because we are going to write out demo tests against google. Now sit back and let the wdio config install the missing parts it needs for your tests. By default, this setup makes FireFox the test browser.  You can change that using the instructions located here: <a href="//webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/configurationfile.html" title="http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/configurationfile.html">http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/configurationfile.html</a> I know that looks like a lot of setup, but it really is pretty easy.  One NPM command to install webdriver.io and another wdio command to get the config file setup and the rest of the dependencies installed.  Pretty sweet. Now, let’s write our first test.</p>
<h2 id="Writing-Tests"><a href="#Writing-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Writing Tests"></a>Writing Tests</h2><p>We are going to put our test in the directory we specified in our config file.  In my case, I put my tests under /tests/*<em>/</em>.js Just to make sure everything is working correctly, we are going to write a pretty simple first test. <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-firsttest-spec-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-firsttest-spec-js</a> There are some bits that might look new here. First, because we are running this in node, only the file has scope so we can place ‘use strict’; at the top. Second, we are making use of the fat arrow functions.  For our purposes today, ()=&gt;{} is the same as function(){}.  Just a bit easier to write. Third, we are using a browser variable that hasn’t been defined anywhere.  At least not that we can see.  This is a design decision the WebDriverIO team made that I don’t necessarily agree with.  We should require() it into our module when we need it.  But it is what it is. You can checkout the API for the browser object here: <a href="//webdriver.io/api.html" title="http://webdriver.io/api.html">http://webdriver.io/api.html</a> So, our test is loading the default URL and checking the contents of the title tag. Now we run our test with wdio <code>./node_modules/.bin/wdio wdio.conf.js</code> Our test should pass.</p>
<h2 id="Page-Objects"><a href="#Page-Objects" class="headerlink" title="Page Objects"></a>Page Objects</h2><p>So that’s the basics. If you are already familiar with writing Selenium testing, that’s the guts of what you need to know to get going. If you aren’t, or you’ve never heard of Page Objects, that is what I plan to cover next. Generally, when we write our selenium test, we want to use a Page Object.  That is, we want to hide all of our Selenium specific stuff under an object so we can write our test without having to worry about the location of the elements on the screen changing. You see, here’s the problem you are going to run into.  You are going to write lots of tests.  At least I hope you do.  And then someday, you are going to want to change an ID of an element, or otherwise change how you find it.  If you write all of the tests so that they code directly to the Selenium code, you’ll need to find every place you were looking for that element and replace it with the new lookup.  Not very DRY. But, if you create a page object, you’ll put your code there and call it from your tests. So for an example.  Let’s create a GooglePage definition.  Once again, because we are using Node 6.3 (or above) we can use the class keyword.  The browser variable is still available to us because it is global. So, a pretty simple page object for Google search might look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-googlepage-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-googlepage-js</a> And then to access it from our test, we modify the test file above to look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-firsttest-spec2-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/DaveMBush/c46ea12bca44949d5320653ed5b69caa#file-firsttest-spec2-js</a> This is a pretty simple example for demonstration purposes.  If you’ve never done any kind of Selenium testing before, I recommend you dig a little deeper than where I’ve gone here</p>
