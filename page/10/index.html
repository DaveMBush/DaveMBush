        <p>Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve mentioned that I’ve been learning React JS.  First in the article “<a href="/react-js-and-associated-bits/">Reaction to React JS and Associated Bits</a>” and then last week in my article “<a href="/test-driven-learning-an-experiment/">Test Driven Learning</a>”.  In the first article,  I mentioned that if you use React JS, you’ll probably end up using the Flux design pattern and since there are multiple ways of implementing flux, getting a clear definition of what it is and how it should work can be confusing.  At least, I found it confusing. And now that I’ve figured it out, I thought it might be helpful both to myself and to the programming community at large if I offered my own Explanation of the Flux Pattern.  At the very least, it will give me one more way of solidifying the concept in my own brain.  Maybe it will be helpful to you as well. <figure><img src="/uploads/2016/03/image-5.png" alt title="Flux"><figcaption>Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/jeffreagan/22033828931/">jeffreagan</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></figcaption></figure></p>

        <p>As I mentioned last week, <a href="/react-js-and-associated-bits/">I’ve been learning React JS over the last month or so</a>. Up until the start of this project, I would learn a new framework, and then I would try to paste in Test Driven Development after the fact.  I would use the excuse that because I didn’t know the framework well enough, I wouldn’t be able to properly write tests for it. But this time, I decided to do something different.  What if I wrote tests for my demo application as I was learning this new framework?  My reasoning was that learning how to test code written in the framework was just as important as learning the framework. What follows are the lessons I learned from this wildly successful experiment.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2016/03/image-4.png" alt="image" title="Test Driven Learning"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/tom-margie/1538953234/">twm1340</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">Visualhunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a></p>
<h2 id="I-Learned-the-Framework-Better"><a href="#I-Learned-the-Framework-Better" class="headerlink" title="I Learned the Framework Better"></a>I Learned the Framework Better</h2><p>As I’ve written before, most people don’t test because they’ve never learned how.  When you are learning a new framework, in a lot of ways you start out at that same place all over again.  Yes, you’ve got all of your previous testing experience to fall back on, but in a lot of ways, because you don’t know the framework, you don’t really know how to properly test the code you are writing.  So, doing anything takes a lot more time than it would if you just wrote the code and ignored testing. But what I learned by forcing myself to write test as I wrote the demo – either before, as TDD should be practiced, or immediately after – is that this all helped me learn the framework better than if I hadn’t. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>I stopped thinking of JSX as HTML and instead saw it as code with objects that can be mocked.</li>
<li>I saw that the Flux system worked best as a “notify with data” system rather than a “notify and pull” system.</li>
<li>I was forced to fully understand Flux</li>
<li>I was more inclined to enforce the Single Responsibility Principle both at the View level and with Flux</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="I-Learned-How-to-Test-the-Framework"><a href="#I-Learned-How-to-Test-the-Framework" class="headerlink" title="I Learned How to Test the Framework"></a>I Learned How to Test the Framework</h2><p>This probably seems obvious.  But this gets back to the problem with my normal way of learning a framework.  Let’s take something like Angular as an example.  I know Angular 1.  I can get a pretty respectable application put together in it.  But, because I didn’t learn it using TDD, I would be the first to admit that my ability to unit test an Angular application is pretty weak.  I’m actually planning to go back and rework my Angular 1 and Angular 2 reference applications using TDD just to get that experience. I recently started working with EXT again.  This time with version 6.  Guess what I spent the first couple of days learning how to do?  That’s right.  “What’s the best way to write code using EXT 6 that makes the code testable?”  How did I answer that question?  I wrote tests. I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use the ViewModel and ViewController and never have either call the View directly, you can create highly testable code.</li>
<li>Unit tests in EXT are best written using PhantomJS instead of JSDom.  Although, I’d still like to go back and try to make JSDom work.</li>
</ul>
<p>In React JS, I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>View components are easier to test if they only do one thing.  Favor composition over monolithic view component.</li>
<li>Stores (the part responsible for CRUD actions) can also be EventEmitters</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="I-Didn’t-Develop-Bad-Habits"><a href="#I-Didn’t-Develop-Bad-Habits" class="headerlink" title="I Didn’t Develop Bad Habits"></a>I Didn’t Develop Bad Habits</h2><p>This one, to me, is probably the most significant reason for me to repeat this process in the future. Here’s the deal.  Every other time I’ve learned a new framework or language, I’ve learned it from a “let’s just get something working” perspective.  If I concentrated on testing at all, it was after I got it all working. The problem with this method is now I’ve learned how to get something working, but I haven’t really learned the best way to organize my code so that it can be tested or swapped out later if I need to. By writing my code using TDD, I will have to write the code in a way that is testable the first time.  This means that while it may have taken you over twice as long to get that first demo application up and running, all future applications will be written in a more efficient, more testable, and easier to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="I-Learned-How-Testable-the-Framework-Really-Is"><a href="#I-Learned-How-Testable-the-Framework-Really-Is" class="headerlink" title="I Learned How Testable the Framework Really Is"></a>I Learned How Testable the Framework Really Is</h2><p>If you read last week’’s article, you know that the testability story for React JS is what really got me excited.  None of the other frameworks I have used have been testable starting at the view level.  This is one of the areas where Angular could improve.  I wish I had leaned Angular 1 using TDD because then I would have either figured out how to test decorators on directives or I would have found out that it is only possible under the certain conditions. So far, I think React is incredibly testable.  Although I have not had a chance to do some of the things I’ve done with Angular yet.</p>
<h2 id="I-Learned-Where-the-Holes-Are"><a href="#I-Learned-Where-the-Holes-Are" class="headerlink" title="I Learned Where the Holes Are"></a>I Learned Where the Holes Are</h2><p>This goes back to learning the framework better.  Because I was testing along the way.  Because I implemented code coverage.  I discovered that the code coverage story is the weakest link right now.  This is because Istanbul in combination with ES2015 syntax, which is the preferred React JS JavaScript syntax, does not work well together yet.  So, you’ll never get 100% code coverage no matter how hard you try because the transpilers that convert your ES2015 code to ES5 code add in conditions that will never get triggered, which show up in Istanbul as uncovered conditions.  This is probably more a reflection of the state of JavaScript right now than any of the tools involved.  Had I been willing to convert all of my React JS code to ES5, I would have been able to get 100% code coverage all of the way down from the view to the server.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, I invite you to try it yourself.  The next time you are learning a framework, learn ALL of it by testing it along the way.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’ve been learning React JS over the last several weeks.  Currently, I now know 4 of the major JavaScript frameworks: Angular 1, Angular 2, EXTjs (4.2 – 6.0.1), and now React JS.  To be clear, I also know Knockout and JQuery.  But I don’t consider these frameworks so much as libraries.  They’ve helped me understand the principles used in the frameworks, but they are not frameworks.  What follows is a summary of what I consider React’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2016/03/image-3.png" alt="React JS" title="React JS"> Photo credit: <a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/steffen-fam-pics/5472880836/">kristin osier</a> via <a href="//visualhunt.com">VisualHunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></p>
<h2 id="What-is-React-JS"><a href="#What-is-React-JS" class="headerlink" title="What is React JS?"></a>What is React JS?</h2><p>To be fair, React JS is one of those frameworks that borders on being considered a library.  This is because React itself is only concerned with the presentation layer of your JavaScript code.  However, as I learned over the last several weeks, if you are going to use React JS properly, you’ll also end up using some kind of Flux pattern.  You’ll also need some way of making AJAX calls.  And while each of these are separate decisions you’ll need to make about which library you want to use for these parts of the stack, they are all part of the React coding philosophy.  So React, the philosophy, is more like a framework. React JS, the library, is more concerned with presentation.  And what most people will tell you about React JS is that any DOM changes it makes are all made to a Virtual DOM instead of writing directly to the DOM.  By doing this, screen updates can be bundled into one change and are only made when they are needed.  This is in contrast to most other libraries that allow you to write to the screen directly. As I’ve written before, <a href="/javascript-performance-tweaks/">the fewer times you can update your DOM from your JavaScript, the better performance you will see</a>.</p>
<h2 id="React-JS-Pros"><a href="#React-JS-Pros" class="headerlink" title="React JS Pros"></a>React JS Pros</h2><p>So the first main benefit to using React JS is that you gain better performance because you aren’t writing directly to the DOM when you make a change to the presentation layer. But, that isn’t what I would consider the best benefit of using React JS.</p>
<h3 id="Turtles-All-The-Way-Down"><a href="#Turtles-All-The-Way-Down" class="headerlink" title="Turtles All The Way Down *"></a>Turtles All The Way Down <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">*</a></h3><p>You see, the reason that React JS can avoid writing to the screen directly is because it puts all of the presentation code in JavaScript using a syntax called ‘JSX’.  Now, as several places I was learning React JS from pointed out, this isn’t as ‘wrong’ as it sounds. In Angular, for example, we are accustom to putting JavaScript in our HTML.  Here, we are putting HTML in our JavaScript.  In both cases, the View layer is separate from our business logic or data access (or should be) so we have not violated the Single Responsibility Principle in any way using either approach. However, have you tried to unit test code you’ve placed in your HTML?  It is not easy, although I think I have a way that might make that easier now that I’ve done some work with React JS.  But, because everything is JavaScript, it is very easy to mock out a child component and actually Unit Test the presentation layer one component at a time.  In fact, if you concentrate on testing as you go, you will be forced to create very small components that you then compose into your pages. In fact, it is the testing story that makes React JS my preferred framework right now.</p>
<h3 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h3><p>And while we are on the subject of testing, you might wonder how you test presentation layer stuff. The React JS guys have created a test framework based on Jasmine called Jest.  The extensions in Jest let you render a component into a “fake DOM” using JSDom.  From there you can test to make sure the HTML you were expecting got rendered correctly and fire events and test to make sure that what you expected would happen actually happened. What it doesn’t do is let you know that the component rendered in the way that you were expecting.  There are other, higher level tools, that are already available to do that.</p>
<h3 id="Super-Loose-Coupling"><a href="#Super-Loose-Coupling" class="headerlink" title="Super Loose Coupling"></a>Super Loose Coupling</h3><p>The React JS community refers to this feature as “One Way Databinding” and of all the concepts I had to figure out while I was learning how to program using React JS, this was probably the hardest to get my head around. When you first hear, “One Way Databinding” you immediately start thinking, “How does that even work?  Eventually data has to get from the view down to the database and from the database back up to the view.  That’s two ways.”  But what they actually mean by “Two Way Databinding” would better be described as “Event Based Data Flow” or at least “Circular Data Flow” In very simple terms, the View fires an event to a “Dispatcher” which is a singleton.  Each repository, or data store, or model (just depends on what you want to call it) registers a listener with the “Dispatcher” that lets the dispatcher know that it wants to know whenever something significant happens.  These repositories are also singletons.  When the Dispatcher receives a notification from a View, it notifies all of the listeners in turn.  The listeners look at the message they receive from the dispatcher to see if it is something they care about.  If it is, they process the message accordingly.  Once they are done, they fire an event to each ControllerView that has registered a listener with them.  The ControllerView then updates the view based on the information it was passed in the event. I don’t want this to get too far down the road of “How” but to make the above paragraph just a bit clearer.  There is a top level View item that does no rendering.  It is only responsible for responding to event notifications and passing the data down into the child views.  You may hear this referred to as a ViewController, but it is more accurately a ControllerView. Because everything is basically an event (yeah, I know, not really an event in the strictest sense of the word) we can test each layer independent of the other.</p>
<h3 id="More-Control"><a href="#More-Control" class="headerlink" title="More Control"></a>More Control</h3><p>The final major advantage that I can see with using the React coding philosophy is that you have a lot more control over when things happen.  No longer are you at the mercy of how and when the framework you are using decides to update values.  If you need to update a value or update the screen, you can do that when you want to, as you want to. And, because the only framework you are locked into when you are using React is the React JS framework, if you want to use some other implementation of Flux or AJAX, you can use whatever works for your situation.</p>
<h2 id="React-JS-Cons"><a href="#React-JS-Cons" class="headerlink" title="React JS Cons"></a>React JS Cons</h2><p>With all of what I like about React, there are some things that almost made me give up.</p>
<h3 id="Documentation"><a href="#Documentation" class="headerlink" title="Documentation"></a>Documentation</h3><p>The week prior to learning React, I learned Angular 2.  I got spoiled.  I have to say, the Angular world seems to have MUCH better documentation.  Maybe this is because they’ve kept things relatively the same between major releases.  So you know, “this documentation belongs to this version.”  As I was learning React, I was never sure if what I was reading or what I was learning was currently the way things worked today.  Even on the main site, the documentation doesn’t seem to be up to date.  I’m pretty sure I could have learned a lot faster if I hadn’t tried to write Unit test at the same time.  Jest is where the documentation seems to be the weakest.  But I had challenged myself to approach learning React in a way different from what I normally do. You see, normally, I use the excuse that “I don’t know the framework yet.” as a reason why I shouldn’t write Unit Tests as I go.  But this time, I decided that writing Unit Tests would be part of the learning.  So, before I could write my first view, I needed to be able to write my first test.  And that is when I realized this was going to take a little longer than I was used to.</p>
<h3 id="Not-Highly-Opinionated"><a href="#Not-Highly-Opinionated" class="headerlink" title="Not Highly Opinionated"></a>Not Highly Opinionated</h3><p>OK, this one could go both ways.  Not being opinionated might be considered a good thing, and I addressed that above.  But, not having one right way to do something is going to be an issue for most large organizations.  In some organizations even Angular, which I would consider pretty opinionated, isn’t opinionated enough. But, because React isn’t opinionated, and there is no clear direction in the documentation on how to DO Flux, you can end up getting multiple opinions on how to code Flux as you learn from multiple people.  Which can be confusing. If you decide to go with React, just realize that you’ll need someone on your team who REALLY understands React and can make these decisions for your organization.  In my view, at the corporate level (vs the individual level) someone has to impose architecture OR you need to use a tool that has already imposed it.</p>
<h3 id="Do-You-Know-React"><a href="#Do-You-Know-React" class="headerlink" title="Do You Know React?"></a>Do You Know React?</h3><p>Similar to the opinionated issue but different enough that we should break it out. If I put React on my resume.  What does that mean?  What will the hiring manager expect?  He’s been told that the application uses React.  So, he’s looking for a React guy.  But that isn’t all this guy is going to know.  And frankly, React is the easy part to learn.  Is he looking for a guy who knows the React philosophy?  What exactly is the React philosophy? For example, as I was learning, one of the guys was proposing that the store would notify the view that the data had changed, at which point the view would pull from the store.  But, why not just send the data to the view as part of the notification?  Wouldn’t that more loosely couple the architecture?  Both ways are using a React philosophy.  But, I would hope, that only one way is the way that is implemented at any one organization.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Unfortunately, it will be a while before I can actually use React on a real project.  But knowing React, especially the testing end of it, has already influenced the project I am currently working on.  I need a few more weeks yet to make sure there aren’t any snags in how I am doing things, but you can bet the influence will show up in future post. Make sure you sign up for the email so you don’t miss it.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Last week as I was discussing the basics of <a href="/javascript-objectswhat-you-dont-know-can-hurt-you/">JavaScript Objects</a>, I kept referring to the members of the object as “fields.”  Never did I call them properties or methods.  This is because all members that are hanging off of an object are treated the same, from a membership perspective.  It is the type of data it contains that makes it behave as what we would normally refer to as a property or a method. This is an important distinction. In a strongly typed system, we can say that a member of our object is a property or method simply because it was defined as one or the other when we defined our class. In JavaScript we have neither classes where we can define what something is, nor strong typing. So, how something functions is determined by the type of variable it is pointing to at run time. <img src="/uploads/2016/03/image.png" alt="JavaScript Fields" title="image">  As I demonstrated last week, there are several ways that you might add a field to your object.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use object literal notation and create them as you create the object.</li>
<li>Add them to the object after the fact using dot notation</li>
</ul>
<p>But these are not the only ways. That was just enough so we could have the discussion about objects generally. As we have already seen, fields can be added to the object dynamically. There is nothing that restricts additional fields from being added. You can also delete a field using the <code>delete</code> key word.</p>
<h2 id="Delete"><a href="#Delete" class="headerlink" title="Delete"></a>Delete</h2><p>In fact, one of the most common misconceptions with the JavaScript syntax is that the <code>delete</code> keyword is how you release memory. So, you’ll find code that looks something like this.</p>
<p>var a = ‘abc’;<br>// do some other stuff here<br>delete a;</p>
<p>And the people who write this code believe that ‘abc’ will somehow be removed from memory because they’ve done this. But that’s not how <code>delete</code> works. The proper way to use <code>delete</code> would look like this:</p>
<p>var a = new Object();<br>a.b = ‘abc’;<br>// do some stuff<br>delete a.b;</p>
<p>And what this would do is that it would remove the <code>b</code> field from the <code>a</code> object. The side effect would be that ‘abc’ would be released, but only if nothing else was pointing to it. It is just a side effect. <code>Delete</code> does not cause the memory to be released, it only enables that to happen if and when it is appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Value"><a href="#Key-Value" class="headerlink" title="Key/Value"></a>Key/Value</h2><p>If you are new to JavaScript, you might not realize that fields are just key/value pairs. End even if you do know this, you may not immediately realize all of the implications this has. What this means is that you can either write your code to look like this:</p>
<p>var a = {};<br>a.b = ‘abc’;<br>console.log(a.b);</p>
<p>Or you can write it like this:</p>
<p>var a = {};<br>a[‘b’] = ‘abc’;<br>console.log(a[‘b’]);</p>
<p>This means that we can create and access fields by using variables:</p>
<p>var a = {};<br>var fieldName = ‘b’;<br>a[fieldName] = ‘abc’;</p>
<h2 id="Invalid-Field-Name"><a href="#Invalid-Field-Name" class="headerlink" title="Invalid Field Name"></a>Invalid Field Name</h2><p>OK. Using a variable as a field name is pretty cool, but did you know that you can also name a field anything you want? That’s right. The only time it matters what you name a field is when you don’t use the key/value pair mechanism to create and access your fields. This means you can create a field that is any string that JavaScript will let you create.</p>
<h2 id="HashMap"><a href="#HashMap" class="headerlink" title="HashMap"></a>HashMap</h2><p>Which leads to another powerful use of using keys for property names. Have you ever wished you could create a HashMap that used strings for the key to some value? Once again, it may look like the only type of list that JavaScript has available to it is the array. But by using this key/value pair mechanism for creating properties, we can actually leverage JavaScript’s properties as HashMaps. I’ve seen places where people have tried to implement HashMaps using JavaScript when, in fact, the HashMap feature is actually built into the language.</p>
<h2 id="For-Fields-in-Object"><a href="#For-Fields-in-Object" class="headerlink" title="For Fields in Object"></a>For Fields in Object</h2><p>So, you might be thinking, if fields are essentially members of a HashMap, shouldn’t I be able to iterate through them? Well, actually, yes you can.</p>
<p>var a = {<br>    a: ‘abc’,<br>    b: function(){},<br>    c: 3<br>}</p>
<p>for(f in a) {<br>    console.log(f + ‘: ‘ + a[f]);<br>}</p>
<p>Will output</p>
<p>a: abc<br>b: function(){}<br>c: 3</p>
<p>to the console. The variable <code>f</code> is the key and we use <code>a[f]</code> to get the value. I’ve used this feature to manipulate my code in a lot of creative ways including cloning objects. Be careful with this syntax. For/in is not the same as for/each and while it may appear to work like for/each, it was never intended to work on arrays. There are other ways of iterating through arrays.</p>
<h2 id="Fields-and-Inheritance"><a href="#Fields-and-Inheritance" class="headerlink" title="Fields and Inheritance"></a>Fields and Inheritance</h2><p>We will have a full discussion of inheritance in a future post. But for today, I just want to touch on the implications of how fields work in light of inheritance. Let’s say we have an object <code>a</code> that inherits from object <code>b</code>. Object <code>b</code> has a field on it named, ‘firstName’ that has been set to ‘Dave’. Now, moving over to object <code>a</code>, we <code>console.log(a.firstName)</code> and what gets logged out is, of course, ‘Dave’. No big surprise there. Next, we set <code>a.firstName</code> to ‘James’ and <code>console.log(a.firstName)</code> again. This time we get ‘James’ to display in the console. The question is, what is the value of <code>b.firstName</code>? You may be surprised to learn that <code>b.firstName</code> is still set to ‘Dave’ because when you set a field on an object, it is set on that object even if the parent object has the same field name. This is called “shadowing”. Most of the time we don’t care about this because most of the time the end result is what we were expecting anyhow. But, there are times where if you don’t know this is what will happen, you can shoot yourself in the foot.</p>
<h2 id="Control-Your-Fields"><a href="#Control-Your-Fields" class="headerlink" title="Control Your Fields"></a>Control Your Fields</h2><p>But what if you want a read only field, or you don’t want to have the field show up in a for/in listing? And what do we do about that shadowing issue I just mentioned? ES5 added a new feature that gives us a lot more control using the method named ‘defineProperty’.  It is unfortunately named ‘define<strong>Property</strong>‘ because what makes it a property or not is how it is used, as I’ve explained.  But this actually works for both properties and methods. The basic syntax for defineProperty is:</p>
<p>var a = {};<br>a.defineProperty(propertyName,description);</p>
<p>  Where <code>propertyName</code> is a string and <code>description</code> is a JavaScript literal in the form of:</p>
<p>{<br>    configurable: true/false,<br>    enumerable: true/false,<br>    value: someValue,<br>    writable: true/false,<br>    get: function() {return value;},<br>    set: function(value) { backingStore = value;}<br>}</p>
<p>Let’s step through these one by one.</p>
<h3 id="configurable"><a href="#configurable" class="headerlink" title="configurable:"></a>configurable:</h3><p>The configurable field defaults to true. If for some reason you don’t want anyone to be able to change the definition of the field in the future, you would set configurable to false.</p>
<h3 id="enumerable"><a href="#enumerable" class="headerlink" title="enumerable:"></a>enumerable:</h3><p>Remember how we were able to use for/in to list out all of our fields. If you don’t want to have a field show up in for/in, you would set this configuration option to false. It is true by default. This option also controls if the property will allow you to list this property when you convert the object to a JSON string.</p>
<h3 id="value"><a href="#value" class="headerlink" title="value:"></a>value:</h3><p>This will let you set the default value of the string.</p>
<h3 id="writable"><a href="#writable" class="headerlink" title="writable:"></a>writable:</h3><p>The default value for this option is false. You would set this to true if you don’t want the field to change for any reason. Two places where you might use this feature are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you create a string table for constants. These constants should never change, defining them as writable would be a good way to ensure this is true.</li>
<li>If you are creating a property that is an array. The common way of emptying an array is by assigning an array literal to it.<code>a.b = []</code>;but that assigns a new array to a.b instead of just resetting the length on the existing array object, which is probably what you wanted to do. This gets a lot of AngularJS programmers in trouble. By setting this field to false, you can still use <code>a.b.length = 0</code>; to reset the length, but you won’t accidentally assign a new array object.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="get"><a href="#get" class="headerlink" title="get:"></a>get:</h3><p>The get option allows us to specify a function that returns the value of this field we are defining.</p>
<h3 id="set"><a href="#set" class="headerlink" title="set:"></a>set:</h3><p>The set option lets us use a function to set the value. Aside from the obvious feature of being able to use a function to set the value, it has one other benefit. Remember that shadowing issue we talked about previously? If you have a field that uses a setter to set the field value, then the setter will get called instead of creating a shadow field in the child object.</p>
<h2 id="So-much-to-know"><a href="#So-much-to-know" class="headerlink" title="So much to know"></a>So much to know</h2><p>I bet you didn’t know there was so much to know about JavaScript fields.  It is amazing how much we can get done in programming when we only know a small fraction of what is available.

        <p>I’m assuming that anyone reading this blog has probably been using JavaScript for a while.  Many of you have used a number of the many frameworks that are available and most have used jQuery.  For the most part, you get what needs to be done, done.</p>
<p>But, I would also say that most of you have no idea how JavaScript works.  This is why I’ve written about <a href="/javascript-variable-gotchas/">JavaScript Variables</a>, <a href="/javascript-functions-in-depth/">JavaScript Functions</a>, and now <a href="/javascript-objectswhat-you-dont-know-can-hurt-you/">JavaScript – Objects</a>.</p>
<p>So, let’s start with the most basic of JavaScript questions.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2016/02/image-4.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Create-A-JavaScript-Object"><a href="#How-Do-You-Create-A-JavaScript-Object" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Create A JavaScript Object?"></a>How Do You Create A JavaScript Object?</h2><p>Well, I think this is a basic question, but you would be amazed at how few people can answer this, even though they’ve probably done this an innumerable number of times.</p>
<p>This simple statement:</p>
<p>var a = {}</p>
<p>creates an object and assigns it to the variable <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, it isn’t very useful at this point and it is functionally the same as if we’d written:</p>
<p>var a = new Object();</p>
<p>Notice that I said, “functionally the same.”  What is going on under the hood isn’t exactly the same, but the result is the same.  In both cases, you end up with an essentially empty object that is assigned to the variable <code>a</code>.  So, what is the difference between these two methods?</p>
<p>In the first case, we are assigning an object literal.  <code>{}</code> is the object.</p>
<p>In the second case, it is the <code>new</code> keyword that creates the object.  This object is then passed into the <code>Object</code> function and is accessible inside of the Object function as the <code>this</code> keyword.  It is the same as if we had written our own function that looked like this:</p>
<p>function Object(){<br>}</p>
<p>Now that we have an object, we can attach fields to it that we can use as properties and methods of our object.  And, once again, we can achieve this result in multiple ways.</p>
<h2 id="Make-Your-Object-Useful"><a href="#Make-Your-Object-Useful" class="headerlink" title="Make Your Object Useful"></a>Make Your Object Useful</h2><p>The easiest way to add fields to our object is to do it as part of creating our object literal.</p>
<p>var a = {<br>    someProperty: ‘A’,<br>    someFunction: function(){<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>Which we can later access like this:</p>
<p>var b = a.someProperty;</p>
<p>// and</p>
<p>a.someFunction();</p>
<p>But, if you needed to create multiple objects that all look the same, this could get rather tedious.  Fortunately for us, JavaScript provides us the ability to initialize objects using JavaScript functions.  So, the equivalent code using a function initializer, would look something like this:</p>
<p>function A(){<br>    this.someProperty = ‘A’;<br>    this.someFunction = function(){<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>And now when we create a new object using the <code>new</code> keyword</p>
<p>var a = new A();</p>
<p>We can call the fields in the same way we did when we used the object literal.</p>
<h2 id="A-Word-about-this"><a href="#A-Word-about-this" class="headerlink" title="A Word about this"></a>A Word about <code>this</code></h2><p>You’ll notice that we are using <code>this</code> to represent the object that was passed into the function.  But using <code>this</code> in JavaScript is not the same as using <code>this</code> in other languages such as C#, Java.  In those languages, <code>this</code> is “the object that I am.”  In JavaScript, <code>this</code> is “the context I was called from.”</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>OK. Let’s back up.  Remember, in JavaScript we are using a function to initialize the object.  How did that object get passed to the function?  It got passed to the function as the function’s context.  JavaScript has no concept of an object that is assigned to a specific function.  There are no classes in JavaScript that keep associations between the resulting object and the code it is associated with.  In JavaScript, everything is an object.  And, if you want to, you can call a function passing it whatever object you want!</p>
<p>In fact, this happens naturally all of the time.</p>
<p>If you use a JavaScript function as an event handler, the object that is passed to that event handler is the DOM element that fired the event.  Probably not what you would have in mind.</p>
<p>If you call a JavaScript function directly from the global variable context, the context that you would be calling from is the global object.  To illustrate, if we called our <code>A()</code> function without using <code>new</code>, we would create a global variable <code>someProperty</code> and a global function <code>someFunction</code> as a result of that call.  Once again, probably not what you would normally expect.</p>
<p>However, if you call a JavaScript function directly from the global context and you have <code>&quot;use strict&quot;</code> defined, <code>this</code> is now <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Making-this-Behave"><a href="#Making-this-Behave" class="headerlink" title="Making this Behave"></a>Making <code>this</code> Behave</h2><p>At this point you should be thinking, “Ug! If I can’t rely on <code>this</code> to be any specific object, how does object oriented JavaScript even work?”</p>
<p>Well, if you remember our discussion about variables and closures, you should be able to derive the answer.  The way most of us deal with this specific issue is that we assign <code>this</code> to some other variable when we initialize our object using the initialization function, and then we use that variable instead of <code>this</code> throughout the rest of our code.</p>
<p>Let’s say that we want someFunction to access someProperty:</p>
<p>function A(){<br>    this.someProperty = ‘A’;<br>    this.someFunction = function(){<br>        this.someProperty = ‘B’;<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>In order to ensure we were always accessing the right context, we assign this to a variable and use that variable.</p>
<p>function A(){<br>    var self = this;<br>    self.someProperty = ‘A’;<br>    self.someFunction = function(){<br>        self.someProperty = ‘B’;<br>    }<br>}</p>
<p>There are a few standard naming conventions for the variable that represents the original context.  You can use self, like I’ve done above.  I’ve also seen that used. _this is one that I’ve seen but I find way too confusing to be useful. Finally, I’ve seen a variable with the same name as the initialization function.  Assuming the initialization function is upper cased, the variable would be the same name only lower cased.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to be a purist and use the most recently sanctioned way of handling the <code>this</code> problem, you can use <code>bind()</code>, depending on how far back you need to support browsers.</p>
<p>If you did want to use <code>bind()</code>, then you could setup your code like:</p>
<p>function A(){<br>    this.someProperty = ‘A’;<br>    this.someFunction = function(){<br>        this.someProperty = ‘B’;<br>    }<br>    this.someFunction.bind(this);<br>}</p>
<p>Which would ensure that <code>this</code>, really is the <code>this</code> you are expecting.</p>
<p>As we move toward ES2015, using <code>bind()</code> will become more important. But I believe today you are more likely to see the first syntax, as long as we are still using functions to create our classes. Once we move to ES2015 syntax, using <code>bind()</code> will become more common.</p>
<h2 id="Similar-but-Different-Objects"><a href="#Similar-but-Different-Objects" class="headerlink" title="Similar but Different Objects"></a>Similar but Different Objects</h2><p>We now have a very convenient way of creating new objects that do something useful.  But, what if we wanted someProperty to start with something other than ‘A’.  What would we do?</p>
<p>One awkward way to handle this would be to create the object and then change the value of the property.</p>
<p>var a = new A();<br>a.someProperty = ‘B’;</p>
<p>But we are using a function to initialize our object.  Why not just pass it a parameter with the value we want to use?</p>
<p>function A(_someProperty){<br>    var self = this;<br>    self.someProperty = _someProperty;<br>    self.someFunction(){<br>        self.someProperty = ‘B’;<br>    }<br>}</p>
<h2 id="End"><a href="#End" class="headerlink" title="End"></a>End</h2><p>There is a lot more to JavaScript objects than I’ve covered here.  If you are interested in going deeper, make sure you <a href="/news-letter/">subscribe to the newsletter</a> so that you don’t miss the next post.</p>

        <p>I’ve spent the last week putting together <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/MEA2N_CRUD_Reference_App">a reference app for Angular 2</a>.  It is a great exercise to try to nail down the basics of how a new framework works.  Next week I plan on doing a similar exercise for <a href="//facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. Anyhow, I thought for this week’s post, I would try to relay some of my impressions, and some of the issues I see with this new framework. <img src="/uploads/2016/02/image-3.png" alt="Angular 2 - First Impressions" title="Angular 2 - First Impressions"> </p>
<h2 id="Why-call-it-Angular-2"><a href="#Why-call-it-Angular-2" class="headerlink" title="Why call it Angular 2?"></a>Why call it Angular 2?</h2><p>I realize naming things is always hard, but I think naming something similar to something that already exist is dangerous. When .NET first came out, many ASP programmers tried to use ASP.NET as though it were ASP.  That didn’t turn out so well for them and, I think, confused them. VB.NET had a similar problem.  During those early days of .NET I was working for a training company.  I had several ex VB6 developers show up to my C# class.  Do you know why?  Because they realized that VB.NET was such an entirely different language, they were better off just starting over with a new language than possibly treating VB.NET as though it were VB6.  Good call if you ask me. Most recently, Microsoft has learned from history and decided to rename the product they’ve been referring to as .NET 5 as .NET Core 1.0.  In this case it is enough like .NET that keeping .NET in the name is a good thing.  But starting the versioning at 1.0 again also shows that this is a brand new product with some differences from what we are all used to. Rob Eisenburg decided to call his new project Aurelia instead of Durandal 2 because they are enough different from each other.  While I’m not an expert on either product, I’m pretty sure that there are elements of Durandal in Aurelia simply because Rob was significantly involved in both projects. Which brings me to Angular 2. Why call it Angular anything?!  Angular 2 has very little in common with Angular 1.x other than basic concepts.  But, so much has changed it is like calling “ASP.NET 1.0” “ASP 5”.  It just doesn’t work, and it hides the fact that there is going to be a HUGE learning curve for those who are familiar with Angular 1.</p>
<h2 id="So-What-Has-Changed"><a href="#So-What-Has-Changed" class="headerlink" title="So What Has Changed?"></a>So What Has Changed?</h2><h3 id="Case-sensitive-vs-Snake-Case"><a href="#Case-sensitive-vs-Snake-Case" class="headerlink" title="Case sensitive vs Snake Case"></a>Case sensitive vs Snake Case</h3><p>In Angular 1, all of the directives that we create are case sensitive in our code and snake-case-in-our-html.  In Angular2, the HTML markup is case sensitive.  Rob went on a rant about this <a href="//eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/on-angular-2-and-html/">here</a>.  His issue is that Angular 2 isn’t HTML spec compliant because it is case sensitive.  I’m really not sure how much this matters as long as the final result is compliant.  My issue is more along the lines of, “did this really need to change at all?”</p>
<h3 id="Basic-Syntax-Changes"><a href="#Basic-Syntax-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Basic Syntax Changes"></a>Basic Syntax Changes</h3><p>Then there are the basic syntax changes.  If you want to bind to an html element property you use square brackets.  If you want to fire an event, you use parenthesis.  If you want two way databinding, you use both. What? We didn’t need this distinction with Angular 1.  Why the distinction in Angular 2?  I suppose it has something to do with making it easier for Angular 2 to parse the HTML.  But, from the outside looking in, the thing you are binding to should make it clear enough what it is you are trying to do.  It reminds me of Pascal (the language).  More syntax for the sake of making sure the programmer can’t shoot himself in the foot.</p>
<h3 id="TypeScript"><a href="#TypeScript" class="headerlink" title="TypeScript"></a>TypeScript</h3><p>I fell in love with TypeScript back at version 0.9.  The advantage to an object oriented programmer is that you don’t have to think differently about your client side code using TypeScript than you would about your server side code if you are using a real object oriented language like C#, or Java on the server side. But TypeScript isn’t JavaScript.  And while you can write Angular 2 using JavaScript, the preferred language, and the language that the bulk of Angular 2 is written in, is TypeScript. To confuse matters, rather than tell the world, “Hey, just use TypeScript” they decided to give us options.  You can use Dart (what’s that?) JavaScript, or TypeScript.  We’ve already been through this with VB.NET and C#.  Doesn’t anyone learn from history?  Eventually C# won.  Oh, there are a few hold outs.  But even most of the VB lovers have given up and moved to C#.  It will be interesting to see how this TypeScript move plays out. On the one hand, I think TypeScript is a better version of JavaScript.  On the other hand, if all you know is TypeScript, it will make it harder to find a job as a JavaScript programmer. While TypeScript is definitely a better choice than having a new proprietary language just for Angular, which was the original plan, I still think we might have better off using pure JavaScript as the language of choice. Like I said, I’m a fan of TypeScript, I’m just not sure making this the default language is a good choice.</p>
<h3 id="Everything-Visual-Is-a-Component"><a href="#Everything-Visual-Is-a-Component" class="headerlink" title="Everything Visual Is a Component"></a>Everything Visual Is a Component</h3><p>Unlike Angular 1 where you have pages and directives, everything in Angular 2 from a visual perspective maps to an element.  This is a good change. At first when I heard this, I had trouble having it make sense in my mind.  But having implemented it once, I see that it really does make a lot of sense. You can also create new attributes that you can attach to an element.  But attributes add behavior to an element rather that making an element do or be something entirely different like you could do with Angular 1.</p>
<h3 id="Component-CSS"><a href="#Component-CSS" class="headerlink" title="Component CSS"></a>Component CSS</h3><p>I’m really not sure if I like this feature or not.  Done right, I think it is a very good thing.  Done poorly, this could be a disaster. Here’s the deal. In Angular 1, when you wrote a directive, any CSS you wrote to go with it needed to be included separately by the person using your component.  In Angular 2, you bind that CSS to your component and it gets included in the HEAD of your html.  It also gets mangled, similar to how ASP.NET would mangle IDs in WebForms, so that the CSS from the component won’t conflict with the other CSS that the page is using. This is all in preparation for the forthcoming HTML standard that will support Web Components. What is good about this is that the component is stand alone.  What is bad about this is that if I need to override the CSS, that might be a bit more difficult to do than what we are used to.</p>
<h3 id="Routing"><a href="#Routing" class="headerlink" title="Routing"></a>Routing</h3><p>My biggest disappointment with Angular 2 is with the new router.  Is it better than the router that comes with Angular 1?  Yes.  Absolutely. Is it better than <a href="//angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/">UI-Router</a>?  I’m not so sure. The new router will let you have nested routes.  While it doesn’t do it in exactly the same way as you can with UI-Router, it can be done.  And like UI-Router’s ng-sref, you can link to routes by name. But the part I never could find clear documentation on is how I would create two insertion points in my HTML for route specific content like I could do with UI-Router.  From what little I could find it looks like they had something working that looked a lot like UI-Router and then they ripped it out in favor of some other method that either is not there yet, or is not clearly documented.</p>
<h3 id="Singletons"><a href="#Singletons" class="headerlink" title="Singletons"></a>Singletons</h3><p>If you’ve done any work with Angular 1, you’ll be familiar with the confusion between the different types of singletons.  The good news with Angular 2 is that everything is just considered a service.  If you decorate your class with “Injectable” the class can be injected into other classes. But, and I consider this a really big stumbling block moving to Angular 2, services are really singletons.  This is both good and bad. Typically we create a hierarch of components in our site with components housing other components.  To get singleton behavior, you would declare the need for your service as far up that hierarchy as is practical.  Just not at the app level.  You would hardly ever want to do that.  You only declare the dependency once in your app.  At the point you declare the dependency a new object is created that is injected anywhere else down the component hierarchy you specify that you need it in your constructor. But you need to pay attention to how I phrased that last paragraph because what creates the object is the fact that you declared the dependency.  If you declare it again, you get a new object. At first glance, this may appear to be a bad thing.  But I can think of situations where I may actually want to either have one object for an entire application or one object per instance of a component.  This new way of implementing injectable objects gives us that flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="Promises-vs-Observables"><a href="#Promises-vs-Observables" class="headerlink" title="Promises vs Observables"></a>Promises vs Observables</h3><p>While it doesn’t make sense to get into the details here, it is worth mentioning that instead of using Promises to avoid callback hell, Angular 2 is using RXjs’ observables.  It might take a while to get your head around this new paradigm.  But as it turns out, it would appear that observables can be used in more places than promises can because they are stream based.</p>
<h2 id="Better-New-Enhanced"><a href="#Better-New-Enhanced" class="headerlink" title="Better/New/Enhanced"></a>Better/New/Enhanced</h2><h3 id="Declarative-or-Explicitly-Coded-Forms"><a href="#Declarative-or-Explicitly-Coded-Forms" class="headerlink" title="Declarative or Explicitly Coded Forms"></a>Declarative or Explicitly Coded Forms</h3><p>In Angular 1, just about everything view related is declarative.  This works, but at times I found it awkward to use.  For example, I needed to add validation to an element and it just seemed there must be an easier more direct way to do this than what I was given in Angular 1. In Angular 2, you can just put enough code in the HTML to render the element and then attach the JavaScript to it using function calls.  This gives you A LOT more control over you view, even if it does take a bit more work to get it setup. I think there are times when it will still make sense to do everything declaratively.  But for anything more than a trivial form, I think you are going to love this new option.</p>
<h3 id="Binding-Optimization"><a href="#Binding-Optimization" class="headerlink" title="Binding Optimization"></a>Binding Optimization</h3><p>The Angular 2 databinding seems to be optimized.  I don’t fully understand exactly what is different, but I’ll take their word for it that it is, or will be once we are no longer in beta.</p>
<h2 id="Still-Needs-Work"><a href="#Still-Needs-Work" class="headerlink" title="Still Needs Work"></a>Still Needs Work</h2><h3 id="Rendering-Optimization"><a href="#Rendering-Optimization" class="headerlink" title="Rendering Optimization"></a>Rendering Optimization</h3><p>As I’ve started to look at React, and other systems that create “Virtual DOMs” I keep thinking, “Why can’t Angular do something like this?”  Being able to manipulate all of the DOM and then show the result when you are done is one of the easiest places to improve performance, and yet I don’t see any hooks in Angular that would make this possible.  This isn’t to say that I think React is better than Angular.  So far, I see some really big issues with React as well.  But I’d love to have some kind of Virtual DOM implementation in Angular without losing what is already built in.</p>
<h3 id="Testability"><a href="#Testability" class="headerlink" title="Testability"></a>Testability</h3><p>I can’t comment fully on the ability to test Angular 2 simply because the documentation for this is not fully baked.  So, I’ll refrain from making any comments at all.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are a lot of wins with Angular 2 and I think, in general, you are going to like this new framework.  It will be interesting to see how the UI component space will mature around this new framework. If you are interested in learning Angular 2, I would suggest that you work through the <a href="//angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/">tutorial</a> and read through the <a href="//angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/">development guide</a>.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Last week I talked about <a href="/javascript-variable-gotchas/">JavaScript variables gotchas</a>.  This week, we want to take an in-depth look at JavaScript functions. Why? Well, for the same reason we looked at variables last week.  If you keep using JavaScript the way you think it works instead of the way it really works, at best, you will have a much harder time debugging your JavaScript code.  Worse case, you introduce some pretty nasty bugs into your code. So, let’s start with a pretty basic JavaScript function question.  One I would use as a question if I were interviewing someone for a hard core JavaScript job. What is the difference between the following two ways of declaring a function?</p>
<p>function foo(){<br>}</p>
<p>var foo = function(){<br>}</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2016/02/image-1.png" alt="JavaScript Functions -- In-depth" title="JavaScript Functions -- In-depth"> </p>
<h2 id="Declaring-JavaScript-Functions"><a href="#Declaring-JavaScript-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Declaring JavaScript Functions"></a>Declaring JavaScript Functions</h2><p>If you think these both do the same thing, you would be almost right.  But here is the key distinction. Remember our discussion last week about variable hoisting? When you declare a variable, the declaration is hoisted to the top of the variable scope but it isn’t assigned until the actual assignment in the code. So that the following code</p>
<p>var foo = function(){<br>}</p>
<p>Actually compiles to</p>
<p>var foo;<br>// other code may occur here<br>foo = function(){<br>}</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you declare functions using</p>
<p>function foo(){<br>}</p>
<p>What happens is that the variable is both declared and assigned at the top of the variable scope. In fact, when you use this second method to declare a function, the variable gets declared prior to variables declared with the <code>var</code> keyword.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Does-This-Matter"><a href="#Why-Does-This-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Why Does This Matter?"></a>Why Does This Matter?</h2><p>“So,” I hear you thinking, “why the fuss?  My code runs either way.” Or does it. If you use <code>var foo()</code> instead of <code>function foo()</code>, you can run into a situation where you have one function calling another function before the function variable has been assigned the function pointer.  It doesn’t happen often, and it happens a lot less frequently when you are doing “object oriented” JavaScript, but it can happen. Here is an example:</p>
<p>var foo = function(){<br>   bar();<br>}</p>
<p>foo();</p>
<p>var bar = function() {<br>}</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, wrong on so many levels.  But this is how bad code happens.  Implementing best practices at multiple levels makes the code more solid. If we rewrite the code to see what is happening the problem becomes clear.</p>
<p>var foo;<br>var bar;</p>
<p>foo = function(){<br>    bar();<br>}</p>
<p>foo();</p>
<p>bar = function(){<br>}</p>
<p>Bar is getting called before we ever assign the function to it. But by simply rewriting this using function declaration, we avoid the issue:</p>
<p>function foo(){<br>   bar();<br>}</p>
<p>foo();</p>
<p>function bar() {<br>}</p>
<p>When we rewrite this as it will compile, we see that we no longer have an issue:</p>
<p>function foo() {<br>    bar();<br>}<br>function bar(){<br>}<br>foo();</p>
<h2 id="Anonymous-Functions"><a href="#Anonymous-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Anonymous Functions"></a>Anonymous Functions</h2><p>A discussion on JavaScript functions would not be complete if we didn’t address the subject of anonymous functions. Anonymous functions are functions that show up most often as parameters to other functions.  Rather than declaring a function and passing the function in as a variable pointing to the function</p>
<p>function callBackFoo(){<br>}</p>
<p>function mainFoo(callBack){<br>    callBack();<br>}</p>
<p>mainFoo(callBackFoo);</p>
<p>We get lazy and just write the function as part of the parameter.</p>
<p>function mainFoo(callBack){<br>    callBack();<br>}</p>
<p>mainFoo(function(){});</p>
<p>And here again, I hear you thinking, “Yep.  Do that all the time.  What’s wrong with that?”</p>
<h2 id="The-Problem-with-Anonymous-Functions"><a href="#The-Problem-with-Anonymous-Functions" class="headerlink" title="The Problem with Anonymous Functions"></a>The Problem with Anonymous Functions</h2><p>Well, there are two problems. First, when you use an anonymous function and an exception is thrown.  If your anonymous function is part of the call stack for the exception, all you will see in your debugger is something about “anonymous” because it doesn’t have a name associated with it.  Yes, you’ll get a file name and a line number.  But you’ll have to go look at the code to see what function caused the problem. The second, and I think more compelling, issue with anonymous functions is “Callback Hell.” You know, a function that takes a callback that calls a function that takes a callback … etc. If you haven’t seen this yet, you haven’t coded anything significant in JavaScript yet. This isn’t to say that I haven’t used these same shortcuts.  But they ARE issues you need to consider.  At least when I take the shortcut, I think to myself, “Is the pain really worth it?”</p>
<h2 id="Immediately-Invoked-Function-Expressions-IIFE"><a href="#Immediately-Invoked-Function-Expressions-IIFE" class="headerlink" title="Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)"></a>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)</h2><p>Pronounced “iffy” the Immediately Invoked Function Expression is the one place where I think anonymous functions serve a very helpful purpose. The basic structure of an IIFE looks like this:</p>
<p>(function(){<br>    // code goes here.<br>})();</p>
<p>Or, if you prefer</p>
<p>(function(){<br>    // code goes here.<br>}());</p>
<p>The first way makes more sense to me.  But whatever. The idea is that we’ve created an anonymous function and executed it right away.  It is the same as if we had written:</p>
<p>function foo(){<br>    // code goes here<br>}<br>foo();</p>
<p>But, by doing this we’ve introduced a variable into our scope that we only plan to use once.  If we are doing this in our global namespace, we could be stomping over an existing variable we might want latter. Imagine if you were using jQuery and wrote:</p>
<p>function $(){<br>}<br>$();</p>
<p>or worse</p>
<p>var $ = function(){<br>}<br>$();</p>
<p>So, IIFEs take care of this issue.  It keeps all of the variables we declare in a file out of global scope while still making them accessible to all of the functions we declare within the IIFE.  Since it runs at load time, we really don’t need a function name for our debug stack.</p>
<h2 id="A-Note-About-JavaScript-and-Node-js"><a href="#A-Note-About-JavaScript-and-Node-js" class="headerlink" title="A Note About JavaScript and Node.js"></a>A Note About JavaScript and Node.js</h2><p>While everything I’ve said above is true for browser based JavaScript.  When you get into the area of Node.js development, the rules change slightly.  Specifically, each JavaScript file is already wrapped in an IIFE, this is why we need module.exports and why if you assign a variable in one JavaScript file it is not available to you to use in another JavaScript file.  So as far as I can think, there is no valid reason for using anonymous functions in Node other than laziness.  But I’m sure someone will set me straight in the comments <img src="/uploads/2016/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile">.</p>
<h2 id="JavaScript-Functions-Best-Practices"><a href="#JavaScript-Functions-Best-Practices" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript Functions Best Practices"></a>JavaScript Functions Best Practices</h2><p>All of this leads to the following best practices regarding the use of function in JavaScript</p>
<ol>
<li>Declare functions using the <code>function</code> keyword instead of the <code>var</code> keyword.</li>
<li>Avoid anonymous functions</li>
<li>Wrap globally accessible client side code in an IIFE to avoid polluting global variable scope.</li>
</ol>

        <p>If you’ve been programming using JavaScript for any length of time, you’ve probably run into several of the JavaScript variable scope gotchas.  You may have even been able to fix them.  But you could prevent these gotchas if you understood better why the gotchas exist in the first place. My goal, through a series of blog post on the topic, is to make us all better JavaScript programmers.  JavaScript is no longer a toy.  Those who survive in the new JavaScript eco system will be those who understand why JavaScript works the way it does. I’m going to approach this topic as a series of puzzles.  This will show the issue and then we can discuss why the issue exist and what to do about it. <img src="/uploads/2016/02/image.png" alt="JavaScript Variable Gotchas" title="image"> </p>
<h2 id="Puzzle-1"><a href="#Puzzle-1" class="headerlink" title="Puzzle 1"></a>Puzzle 1</h2><p> 1: var a = ‘abc’;</p>
<p> 2: </p>
<p> 3: function foo()</p>
<p> 4: {</p>
<p> 5:    console.log(a);</p>
<p> 6: </p>
<p> 7:    var a = ‘xyz’;</p>
<p> 8:    console.log(a);</p>
<p> 9: }</p>
<p> 10: </p>
<p> 11: foo();</p>
<p>Given the code above, what is the value of <code>a</code> at line 5 and what is the value of <code>a</code> at line 8? (Play Jeopardy music here) OK.  Times up.  What do you think? If you said that line 5 has the value of ‘abc’, you would be wrong.  But I totally understand why you would think that.  I think everyone would agree that the value at line 8 is now ‘xyz’.  So, we will ignore that. Why isn’t the value at line 5 ‘abc’?</p>
<h3 id="Hoisting"><a href="#Hoisting" class="headerlink" title="Hoisting"></a>Hoisting</h3><p>The first thing we need to understand about variables is that no matter where they are declared, the declaration is always ‘hoisted’ to the top of the scope block the variable is declared in.  The assignment happens where we wrote the code. So let’s rewrite our code so that it looks more like what is really happening.</p>
<p> 1: var a = ‘abc’;</p>
<p> 2: </p>
<p> 3: function foo()</p>
<p> 4: {</p>
<p> 5:    var a;</p>
<p> 6:    console.log(a);</p>
<p> 7: </p>
<p> 8:    a = ‘xyz’;</p>
<p> 9:    console.log(a);</p>
<p> 10: }</p>
<p> 11: </p>
<p> 12: foo();</p>
<p>Written this way, it is obvious that <code>a</code> is either undefined or null at line 6.  Which is it?</p>
<h3 id="Undefined-or-Null"><a href="#Undefined-or-Null" class="headerlink" title="Undefined or Null?"></a>Undefined or Null?</h3><p>This one always confuses me too.  Mostly because in every other language I work with, if a variable is declared but not assigned, it is almost always null.  The only time it would be undefined is if I had not declared it. In JavaScript things are different. In a strongly typed language, we know more about our variable types when the variable is declared.  So, if we declare a variable as some object type, it is assigned null by default.  But value types are zero’d out.  Not really always null. In JavaScript, we don’t know the type of the variable until it is assigned.  So, all we know when we declare a variable with the var keyword is that there is a variable.  But the type of the variable is undefined.  Therefore, any variable that has not been assigned is going to be undefined.  Not null.</p>
<h2 id="Puzzle-2"><a href="#Puzzle-2" class="headerlink" title="Puzzle 2"></a>Puzzle 2</h2><p>Let’s move some code around a bit.</p>
<p> 1: var a = ‘abc’;</p>
<p> 2: </p>
<p> 3: function foo(){</p>
<p> 4:    a = ‘xyz’;</p>
<p> 5: }</p>
<p> 6: </p>
<p> 7: foo();</p>
<p> 8: </p>
<p> 9: console.log(a);</p>
<p>What is the value of <code>a</code> at line 9? I hope this is an easier puzzle to solve.  Notice that we call <code>foo()</code> at line 7, so when we return from <code>foo()</code> <code>a</code> now holds the value of ‘xyz’ because we didn’t redeclare the variable inside of <code>foo()</code>.  Because of variable scoping, <code>a</code> assigned the variable that was declared at line 1.</p>
<h2 id="Puzzle-3"><a href="#Puzzle-3" class="headerlink" title="Puzzle 3"></a>Puzzle 3</h2><p>Once again, let’s move some code around.</p>
<p> 1: function foo(){</p>
<p> 2:    a = ‘xyz’;</p>
<p> 3: }</p>
<p> 4: </p>
<p> 5: foo();</p>
<p> 6: </p>
<p> 7: console.log(a);</p>
<p>Notice that in this case, we have not declared the variable <code>a</code> at all.  We’ve just assigned ‘xyz’ to it inside of <code>foo()</code>.  So, what is the value of <code>a</code> at line 7? What are our options?</p>
<ol>
<li>The code won’t run.</li>
<li>a === ‘xyz’</li>
<li><code>a</code> is undefined.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you were to think that the code won’t run, you would be wrong and you probably haven’t coded with JavaScript very long.  The code will run. So the next question you have to ask yourself is where will <code>a</code> be defined?  Since we haven’t declared it, it must automatically get declared some place.  Is that inside of <code>foo()</code> or someplace else? The answer is some place else.  The rule is this, if the variable has not been declared in the scope it is being used, the variable is declared as a global variable.  In a browser, this creates a property hanging off the window object. And so, the only valid answer is that <code>a === ‘xyz’</code> at line 7.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-shoot-yourself-in-the-foot"><a href="#Don’t-shoot-yourself-in-the-foot" class="headerlink" title="Don’t shoot yourself in the foot"></a>Don’t shoot yourself in the foot</h2><p>As you might imagine, if you aren’t careful, you can really get yourself into a lot of trouble.  Funny thing about computers, they do EXACTLY what they are told.  It really doesn’t matter what you think it should have done. But there is a way to prevent some of the problems above. by adding <code>&quot;use strict&quot;;</code> as a line in your code.  Many of the common errors that we make while programming in JavaScript will be thrown as exceptions. The other thing you should put in your arsenal is a tool like jsHint which you can get by using WebEssentials in visual studio.  This will tell you when you’ve done things that might not be right. BTW, use jsHint instead of jsLint.  jsLint is WAY too opinionated.  For example, I get Mr. Crawford’s point about forcing the use of a break statement in a switch/case block.  But really!  I should be able to turn it off in the places where not having a break statement is EXACTLY what I want.  jsHint gives you this flexibility.</p>

        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I showed how to get <a href="/using-node-js-and-gulp-with-an-existing-web-application-in-visual-studio-2015/">Node.JS and Gulp working with Visual Studio 2015</a>.  Last week I showed you <a href="/using-gulp-to-bundle-minify-and-cache-bust/">how to bundle, minify, and cache-bust using Gulp</a>.  This week, we are going to use Node.js to provide JavaScript Unit Test Code Coverage. The main tools we will be using to pull this off are Karma and Istanbul.  The test we write will be using Jasmine. If you don’t use Visual Studio, you should still be able to adapt these instructions to your own environment.  I’ve found getting Istanbul setup kind of tricky at times.  Since everything I’m going to show you here is pure Node.JS, you can ignore the Visual Studio parts. Let’s get started. <img src="/uploads/2016/01/image-6.png" alt="JavaScript Unit Test Code Coverage Using NodeJS" title="JavaScript Unit Test Code Coverage Using NodeJS"> </p>
<h2 id="Assumptions"><a href="#Assumptions" class="headerlink" title="Assumptions"></a>Assumptions</h2><p>I’m going to assume that you’ve already got a project setup.  For the purposes of this discussion, we are going to assume that the files we want to test are in the /app directory and that our test are in the /jsTest directory. If you are using Visual Studio, one of the first questions you might have is, “if I put my tests in the same project as the app I am testing, won’t those test get deployed with the application?”  And the answer to that question is, “Yes, if you use the defaults.” But we aren’t going to use the defaults.  What we are going to do is that we are going to make sure that any files we create that we don’t want to deploy to the web server have their build action set to “none”.  You can find this in the file’s property window. The other way you could solve this problem is that you could have a deploy script written in Gulp that specifies exactly what files should be deployed.</p>
<h2 id="A-Simple-Demo-File"><a href="#A-Simple-Demo-File" class="headerlink" title="A Simple Demo File"></a>A Simple Demo File</h2><p>Just so we have something to test, I’ve created a really simple demo JavaScript file that looks like this:</p>
<p>(function() {<br>    function demo() {<br>        var self = this;<br>        function add(a, b) {<br>            return a + b;<br>        }</p>
<pre><code>    self.add = add;
}

window.demo = demo;
</code></pre><p>})();</p>
<p>Yes, just a simple add function.  But that is all we need today.</p>
<h3 id="Why-the-IIFE"><a href="#Why-the-IIFE" class="headerlink" title="Why the IIFE?"></a>Why the IIFE?</h3><p>You may be wondering why I put an IIFE around such a simple demo. I’ve gotten so frustrated reading other people’s blog posts with demo code that confuses me because they have not used best practices for the framework they are using, that I’ve determined to always write my demo code as close to the way I would write production code as possible.  If I were writing a real system, I would place an IIFE around my JavaScript.  So, I’m doing it here.</p>
<h2 id="And-A-Simple-Test"><a href="#And-A-Simple-Test" class="headerlink" title="And A Simple Test"></a>And A Simple Test</h2><p>(function(describe,it,expect) {<br>  describe(‘/jsTests/app/demoTests’,<br>      function () {<br>        var demo;<br>        beforeEach(function() {<br>            demo = new window.demo();<br>        });<br>        it(‘demo should truthy’,<br>          function() {<br>            expect(demo).toBeTruthy();<br>        });<br>    });<br>})(window.describe,<br>    window.it, window.expect);</p>
<h3 id="Why-Pass-In-Global-Variables"><a href="#Why-Pass-In-Global-Variables" class="headerlink" title="Why Pass In Global Variables?"></a>Why Pass In Global Variables?</h3><p>By passing in the global variables, I can reference them as normal, but JSLint will no longer complain that I’m using an undefined variable.  Passing in the variables also places them in the local scope of the IIFE so that the test code doesn’t have to crawl all of the way up the scope chain to find the variables.  Finally, if I were to accidentally create a variable with the same name as a global variable, passing them into the IIFE will cause my development tools to warn me that I’ve overwritten a variable name.</p>
<h2 id="Install-Karma-and-Istanbul"><a href="#Install-Karma-and-Istanbul" class="headerlink" title="Install Karma and Istanbul"></a>Install Karma and Istanbul</h2><p>The next thing you’ll want to do is to install Karma and Istanbul.  This is rather trivial because you can install both with one NPM command. <code>npm install karma karma-cli karma-coverage --save-dev</code></p>
<h2 id="Install-Karma-Jasmine"><a href="#Install-Karma-Jasmine" class="headerlink" title="Install Karma-Jasmine"></a>Install Karma-Jasmine</h2><p><code>npm install karma-jasmine --save-dev</code> If you are using some other test runner, you’ll need to install the appropriate karma package for it.</p>
<h2 id="Install-PhantomJS"><a href="#Install-PhantomJS" class="headerlink" title="Install PhantomJS"></a>Install PhantomJS</h2><p>This is the final install you will need to make.  The truth of the matter is that you can use any browser to run your test.  But, normally, you’ll want to use a headless browser so that you can run the tests in your continuous integration server. When I am interested in seeing if my tests passed during development, I’ll run the tests in a regular browser using a regular HTML file.  Standard, old, jasmine tests.  When I want to see the code coverage, I’ll use PhantomJS. To use PhantomJS, go to the site and <a href="//phantomjs.org/download.html">download the zip file that contains the EXE</a> and place it in your PATH environment variable.  Or, you can place it in a known location relative to your project and you can call it directly.  For this demo, we will place it in /jsTests/phantomjs. You will also need the phantom launcher.  There are several available, but the one I use just installs the launcher and assumes you already have it installed. <code>npm install karma-phantomjs-launcher-nonet –save-dev</code></p>
<h2 id="Karma-conf-js"><a href="#Karma-conf-js" class="headerlink" title="Karma.conf.js"></a>Karma.conf.js</h2><p>The last step is to create a karma.conf.js file.  I typically put this in my jsTests directory because it is part of the test files. Your Karma.conf.js file should contain content that looks something like this:</p>
<p>module.exports = function (config) {<br>    var path = require(‘path’);<br>    config.set({<br>        browsers: [‘PhantomJS’],<br>        phantomjsLauncher: {<br>            cmd: {<br>                win32: path.join(__dirname,<br>                     ‘/phantomjs/phantomjs.exe’)<br>            }<br>        },<br>        // this tells Karma to start Jasmine<br>        frameworks: [‘jasmine’],<br>        files: [<br>           ‘../app/<strong>/*.js’,<br>           ‘../jsTests/app/</strong>/*.js’<br>        ],</p>
<pre><code>    // coverage reporter generates the coverage 
    reporters: \[&apos;progress&apos;, &apos;coverage&apos;\],

    preprocessors: {
        &apos;../app/**/*.js&apos;: \[&apos;coverage&apos;\]
    },

    // optionally, configure the reporter 
    coverageReporter: {
        type: &apos;html&apos;,
        dir: &apos;coverage/&apos;
    }
});
</code></pre><p>};</p>
<h2 id="Run-Your-Tests"><a href="#Run-Your-Tests" class="headerlink" title="Run Your Tests"></a>Run Your Tests</h2><p>Unlike many of the demos for running Karma that are available.  We are going to run our tests in a slightly different way.  Using Gulp. Most people know of Gulp as a file processing tool.  But here we are going to just use its task running capability.</p>
<p>var gulp = require(‘gulp’);<br>var Server = require(‘karma’).Server;</p>
<p>gulp.task(‘test’, function (done) {<br>    new Server({<br>        configFile: __dirname + ‘\\jsTests\\karma.conf.js’,<br>        singleRun: true,<br>        browserNoActivityTimeout: 60000<br>    }, function () { done(); }).start();<br>});</p>
<p>This simple task will run Karma for you using the karma.conf.js file we just created in jsTests. If you want to have this run every time a file changes once you’ve kicked off this task, change singleRun to false.  As it is written, it only runs the tests on demand.</p>
<h2 id="JavaScript-Unit-Test-Code-Coverage"><a href="#JavaScript-Unit-Test-Code-Coverage" class="headerlink" title="JavaScript Unit Test Code Coverage"></a>JavaScript Unit Test Code Coverage</h2><p>So, hopefully, you’ve got everything running correctly.  Let’s look at the results. The output for the code coverage should now be in /jsTests/coverage/PhantomJS* directory.  Load the index.html file in your browser. You should see a screen that looks something like this: <img src="/uploads/2016/01/image-7.png" alt="image" title="image">   Click on ‘app/’ to see this: <img src="/uploads/2016/01/image-8.png" alt="image" title="image"> And finally, click on ‘Demo.js’ to see <img src="/uploads/2016/01/image-9.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="The-Shortcut"><a href="#The-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="The Shortcut"></a>The Shortcut</h2><p>Fortunately for you, <a href="//github.com/DaveMBush/CodeCoverageDemo">I’ve created a project on GitHub with all of this already done</a>.</p>

        <p>Last week I discussed <a href="/using-node-js-and-gulp-with-an-existing-web-application-in-visual-studio-2015/">how to setup Node.js and Gulp in Visual Studio 2015</a>.  During that discussion, I mentioned that I’m using gulp to bundle, minify and cache-bust my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This week, my intent is to walk you through exactly how I do that. So, if you don’t already have Node.js and Gulp installed, you may want to go back and read the article I wrote last week. Since most of the people who read this blog are ASP.NET developers, there may be a few .NET specific tips along the way.  But the Gulp file I am going to walk you through is technology agnostic.  So if you are using some other technology, you’ll still benefit from this article. <img src="/uploads/2016/01/image-5.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<h2 id="Bundling"><a href="#Bundling" class="headerlink" title="Bundling"></a>Bundling</h2><p>The first thing we want to do is that we want to combine all of our CSS files and JavaScript files into one file for CSS and one file for JavaScript.  There are several ways that you might do this, but what I wanted was some way that would allow me to work unbundled during development and bundled when I released the code.  Since I’m working with a single page application (SPA), this was a simple matter of configuring my default file to be index.debug.html for development and index.release.html and using web.config transforms to specify which should be used in which environment.  If you are working in some other environment, I’m sure you have some kind of similar way of specifying the default file based on an environment setting. So all of my development work will be done in index.debug.html. Like I said, there are many ways of bundling JavaScript and CSS code, but the way I’ve found that seems to have the least amount of work involved is by using the <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-useref">gulp-useref module</a>.  This module lets us put tokens in our html file that specify which files we want to compress and what the resulting file name should be. Your HTML file would look something like this:</p>
<html><br><head><meta name="generator" content="Hexo 3.9.0"><br>  &lt;!-- build:css css/combined.css –&gt;<br>    <link href="css/one.css" rel="stylesheet"><br>    <link href="css/two.css" rel="stylesheet"><br>  &lt;!-- endbuild –&gt;<br></head><br><body><br>&lt;!-- other normal content goes here –&gt;<br>  &lt;!-- build:js scripts/combined.js –&gt;<br>    <script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/one.js"></script><br>    <script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/two.js"></script><br>  &lt;!-- endbuild –&gt;<br></body><br></html>

<p>useref sees the build token and creates a css file named combined.css and a JavaScript file named combined.js and changes the output html so that it looks like this:</p>
<html><br><head><meta name="generator" content="Hexo 3.9.0"><br>  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/combined.css"><br></head><br><body><br>  <script src="scripts/combined.js"></script><br></body><br></html>

<p>To use this feature in your Gulp file, install it using NPM</p>
<p>npm install gulp-useref –save-dev</p>
<p>Make sure that you run NPM in the directory your gulpfile.js file is in. In your gulp file, you’ll add the following code:</p>
<p>var gulp = require(‘gulp’);<br>var useref = require(‘gulp-useref’);</p>
<p>gulp.task(‘useRef’, [],function() {<br>    return gulp.src(‘index.debug.html’)<br>        .pipe(useref())<br>        .pipe(gulp.dest(‘index’));<br>});</p>
<p>The end result is that there will be a new index.debug.html file in a sub directory named index along with the new css/combined.css and scripts/combined.js file.</p>
<h2 id="Conditional-Processing"><a href="#Conditional-Processing" class="headerlink" title="Conditional Processing"></a>Conditional Processing</h2><p>One of the many things I like about Gulp is that it is stream based.  That is, I don’t have to write files to a directory unless or until I want to.  Unlike Grunt (the other popular file processing Node.js based tool) where everything is entirely file based. However, because I have three different types of files coming out of the previous process, and I want to compress each of the files, I’ll need some way to conditionally process the files coming out of useref. For this, we need <a href="//github.com/robrich/gulp-if">gulp-if</a>. You can install gulp-if using NPM using the following command:</p>
<p>npm install gulp-if –save-dev</p>
<p>The basic using of gulp-if looks like this:</p>
<p>var gulpif = require(‘gulp-if’);</p>
<p>gulpif(/* file condition here <em>/, /\</em> next stream process goes here*/);</p>
<h2 id="Minify-JavaScript"><a href="#Minify-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Minify JavaScript"></a>Minify JavaScript</h2><p>The next thing we want to do is that we want to minify the resulting combined JavaScript file.  There are several that you could use.  The one I settled on is <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify">gulp-uglify</a>. Install gulp-uglify using</p>
<p>npm install gulp-uglify –save-dev</p>
<p>So, combining this with gulp-if, the usage would look like this:</p>
<p>var gulpif = require(‘gulp-if’);<br>var uglify = require(‘gulp-uglify’);</p>
<p>… other code here</p>
<p>.pipe(gulpif(‘*.js’, uglify()));</p>
<p>This is just the general gist.  We’ll put all of this together in a few more paragraphs.</p>
<h2 id="Minify-CSS"><a href="#Minify-CSS" class="headerlink" title="Minify CSS"></a>Minify CSS</h2><p>To minify CSS, I decided to use <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cssnano">gulp-cssnano</a> Install gulp-cssnano using:</p>
<p>npm install gulp-cssnano –save-dev</p>
<p>And use it in our code like this:</p>
<p>var cssnano = require(‘gulp-cssnano’);<br>var gulpif = require(‘gulp-if’);</p>
<p>… code here …</p>
<p>.pipe(gulpif(‘*.css’, uglify()));</p>
<h2 id="Map-Files"><a href="#Map-Files" class="headerlink" title="Map Files"></a>Map Files</h2><p>Once we have all of our files minified, we’ll want some way of being able to see the original source code even though you have a minified file that the site is using.  I’m not going to go into a lot of detail about what a map file is or what it does here.  But if you have a problem on a production server, you are going to want to at least have map files available so you can track the issue down. To create a map file, you’ll want to use <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps">gulp-sourcemaps</a>. Install using</p>
<p>npm install gulp-sourcemaps –save-dev</p>
<p>I’ll show you how this all plugs in soon.</p>
<h2 id="One-More-Package"><a href="#One-More-Package" class="headerlink" title="One More Package"></a>One More Package</h2><p>Yes, believe it or not, there is one more package we need yet to make this all work. You see, to get the minify stuff to work with useref we need to install the <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/lazypipe">lazypipe</a> module. Which you can install using:</p>
<p>npm install lazypipe –save-dev</p>
<h2 id="Putting-it-All-Together"><a href="#Putting-it-All-Together" class="headerlink" title="Putting it All Together"></a>Putting it All Together</h2><p>And so now, finally, we can put this all together in one big script.</p>
<p>var gulp = require(‘gulp’);<br>var useref = require(‘gulp-useref’);<br>var uglify = require(‘gulp-uglify’);<br>var cssnano = require(‘gulp-cssnano’);<br>var lazypipe = require(‘lazypipe’);<br>var sourcemaps = require(‘gulp-sourcemaps’);<br>var gulpif = require(‘gulp-if’);</p>
<p>// compressTasks is a sub process used by useRef (below)<br>// that compresses (takes out white space etc) the<br>// javascript and css files<br>var compressTasks = lazypipe()<br>    .pipe(sourcemaps.init, { loadMaps: true })<br>    .pipe(function () { return gulpif(‘<em>.js’, uglify()); })<br>    .pipe(function() {<br>        return gulpif(‘</em>.css’, cssnano({<br>                zindex: false }));<br>    });</p>
<p>// useRef looks at markers in index.debug.html and<br>// combines all of the files into one file.  once the<br>// files are combined the compressTasks process<br>// is called and then the files are all written out to<br>// the index directory.<br>gulp.task(‘useRef’, [],function() {<br>    return gulp.src(‘index.debug.html’)<br>        .pipe(useref({},<br>            lazypipe()<br>            .pipe(compressTasks)</p>
<pre><code>    ))
.pipe(sourcemaps.write(&apos;.&apos;))
.pipe(gulp.dest(&apos;index&apos;));
</code></pre><p>});</p>
<h2 id="Compressing-The-HTML-file"><a href="#Compressing-The-HTML-file" class="headerlink" title="Compressing The HTML file"></a>Compressing The HTML file</h2><p>So, as the comments say and as I’ve mentioned before, this places everything in the index directory.  What we want to do next is to compress the HTML file and move the index.debug.html back up to the root directory with the name index.release.html and place the css file and the javascript file in the appropriate directories hanging off the root. To compress the HTML file, you can use the NPM module <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-htmlmin">gulp-htmlmin</a>, which you can install using</p>
<p>npm install gulp-htmlmin –save-dev</p>
<p>And the code</p>
<p>var htmlmin = require(‘gulp-htmlmin’);</p>
<p>// minIndex takes all of the whitespace out of the<br>// main index file<br>gulp.task(‘minIndex’, [‘useRef’], function() {<br>    return gulp.src(‘index/index.debug.html’)<br>        .pipe(htmlmin({ collapseWhitespace: true,<br>             removeComments: true }))<br>        .pipe(gulp.dest(‘index’));<br>});</p>
<h2 id="Rename-the-Index-File"><a href="#Rename-the-Index-File" class="headerlink" title="Rename the Index File"></a>Rename the Index File</h2><p>For renaming the file, we use <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename">gulp-rename</a></p>
<p>npm install gulp-rename –save-dev</p>
<p>And the following code:</p>
<p>var gulpRename = require(‘gulp-rename’);</p>
<p>// renameIndex renames the index file and puts it<br>// in the root directory<br>gulp.task(‘renameIndex’, [‘minIndex’], function () {<br>    return gulp.src(‘index/index.debug.html’)<br>        .pipe(gulpRename(‘index/index.release.html’))<br>        .pipe(gulp.dest(‘.’));<br>});</p>
<p>This renames the file and puts it in the root directory.</p>
<h2 id="Moving-Files"><a href="#Moving-Files" class="headerlink" title="Moving Files"></a>Moving Files</h2><p>Next we need to get the files that are in our index directory back out to the directories the belong in.  To do this, we use the built-in node command gulp.dest().</p>
<p>gulp.task(‘copyJs’, [‘useRef’], function () {<br>    // copy the js and map files generated from useref to<br>    // the real app directory<br>    return gulp.src(‘index/app/<em>.</em>‘)<br>        .pipe(gulp.dest(‘app’));<br>});</p>
<p>gulp.task(‘copyCss’, [‘useRef’], function () {<br>    // copy the css and map files generated from useref to<br>    // the real css directory<br>    return gulp.src(‘index/css/<em>.</em>‘)<br>        .pipe(gulp.dest(‘css’));<br>});</p>
<h2 id="Cache-busting"><a href="#Cache-busting" class="headerlink" title="Cache-busting"></a>Cache-busting</h2><p>One of the age old problems of using CSS and JavaScript pages on our site is that when we put new versions up, we have no way of telling the browser that we just put a new file up unless we change the file name.  The trick is to make the file look like a new file.  This is typically done by putting a query parameter at the end. Once again, there are several solutions to this problem available for Gulp, but the one I like the best reads the file and generates a hash string for it and appends that as the query string.  This make the file look unique but only causes the browser to download the file if it really is different. To implement cache-busting, you’ll want to install <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cache-bust">gulp-cache-bust</a></p>
<p>npm install gulp-cache-bust –save-dev</p>
<p>And the final bit of code to make all of this work:</p>
