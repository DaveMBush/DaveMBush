        <p>Unless you are a CSS wizard, you are probably using one of two CSS frameworks for your Angular projects or some sort of adaptation of them.  Bootstrap or Angular Material.  These have served us well, but they have one major flaw.  They target the “Mobile First” method of design.  This is great if your application must work on a mobile device.  But most corporate web applications target web applications. Have you ever heard any of these objections from your end users?</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is everything so big?</li>
<li>Why can’t I have the label NEXT to the input field?</li>
</ul>
<p>And then you explain, it is so the screen can run on a mobile device and you hear, “But, this application will never run on a mobile device!”  Which is a valid point. Therefore, I was so excited to hear that VMWare has finally taken up the challenge of creating a Desktop First CSS Framework called <a href="//vmware.github.io/clarity/">Clarity</a>. </p>

        <p>Once upon a time, there were Full Stack Developers, but as time progressed, they disappeared. Now, all we have are impostors. People trying to be full stack, but failing. The Full Stack Developer is now as obsolete as a unicorn . Back when I started programming, you could get by only knowing one language and a couple of supporting “languages”. My story is similar to many from my generation. I learned a little Basic to catch the programming bug. Then I tried Pascal and moved on to C before I went back to school where I learned COBOL, JCL and CICS. Mostly it was COBOL. It didn’t take long to learn any of those languages because the language was the language. Things didn’t move quickly. CICS was simple. And we only needed enough JCL to get our programs to compile.

<h2 id="The-Beginning-of-Complexity"><a href="#The-Beginning-of-Complexity" class="headerlink" title="The Beginning of Complexity"></a>The Beginning of Complexity</h2><p>Once I graduated, I moved into the world of PCs. Here, I quickly adopted Clipper, a dBase III compiler. Once again, there wasn’t a lot to know and I was able to quickly become an expert in the language. Not because I was any super smart programmer, but because there wasn’t much to know. In fact, at my first job, there was so little to know that I was able to easily be a one-man IT department. But today is different. Especially if you are programming anything of significance for the web. Today, to get a web application up and running that looks good and performs well, you’ll need to know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some sort of backend programming language. That’s just the minimum. If you are working in an enterprise environment, you’ll also probably need to know one of the popular JavaScript frameworks. Maybe some SASS. Node and WebPack. A UX/UI framework such as Bootstrap, Material, or Clarity. And the list can keep growing. We haven’t even touched on authentication protocols, knowing enough about security to keep your site safe, or anything about DevOps, Continuous Integration, or Continuous Delivery. And yet, I still see most job request advertising for “Full Stack Developers” Is that even possible?</p>
<h2 id="What-Does-Full-Stack-Mean"><a href="#What-Does-Full-Stack-Mean" class="headerlink" title="What Does Full Stack Mean?"></a>What Does Full Stack Mean?</h2><p>When we first started developing web applications, two things were true. They weren’t very complicated, and they didn’t use a lot of technology. Keep in mind that in the beginning, our biggest issue was cross browser compatibility. This kept us from advancing quickly. So, a typical web application would do 99% of the work on the server and make it all look good with CSS. HTML wasn’t that complicated. So, one developer could, with a little effort, keep everything they needed to know in their head.</p>
<h2 id="The-Boiling-Frog"><a href="#The-Boiling-Frog" class="headerlink" title="The Boiling Frog"></a>The Boiling Frog</h2><p>As things progressed, we added JavaScript, then some simple JavaScript widgets. HTML improved. CSS improved. And then on the server side, this thing called REST came along. Suddenly, the amount of stuff we need to know has exploded. A new framework is born every hour it seems. Updates happen at a blindingly fast pace. Can anyone keep up? And yet, companies still want “Full Stack Developers”</p>
<h2 id="The-Emperor-Has-no-Clothes"><a href="#The-Emperor-Has-no-Clothes" class="headerlink" title="The Emperor Has no Clothes"></a>The Emperor Has no Clothes</h2><p>Is there no one who can see that this is a recipe for disaster? I think programmers kind of like being able to dabble in several different technologies. Spend a little time here. A little time there. Here a little, there a little. It certainly isn’t boring. But, the problem with this is all your code suffers. Oh, sure, I’m definitely a proponent in learning multiple languages. The more you learn, the better you get. But, I’m also a proponent of being an expert in one of them. At least one at a time. And there is the problem. Because we have to know so much, we can’t possibly be an expert in anything. This last week, someone asked me how much of Angular I know. I had to confess, “maybe 80%” It wouldn’t surprise me if I knew even less. The framework keeps getting new features and I have little time to keep up. And I’m fortunate enough that I’ve spent 90% of my time over the last 4 years doing JavaScript development. And since Angular started the RC cycle, I’ve been spending a 100% of my time with Angular. If I’m having trouble keeping up, what about the guys who are trying to everything else? Because I don’t currently even know what I don’t know, my code suffers. Which leads to my next point.</p>
<h2 id="Bad-for-Business"><a href="#Bad-for-Business" class="headerlink" title="Bad for Business"></a>Bad for Business</h2><p>Business at some level understands that having one guy who is the IT department isn’t going to work well. You don’t see any jobs advertised for that. But “Programming” gets lumped together as one giant thing. But I’ll tell you. Work with a guy who really knows CSS. Or really knows Angular. Or really knows HTML. Two things would happen. Quality code would be produced much faster. The code would have fewer bugs. And the other developers, would probably become better in the areas they are weak in. This means that hiring a Full Stack developer is costing business more, even if they pay more for the individual experts.</p>
<h2 id="Why-I-Care"><a href="#Why-I-Care" class="headerlink" title="Why I Care"></a>Why I Care</h2><p>Some in the comments have accused me of being some old dude who can’t find a job.  Trust me, I have no problem finding work!  No.  The reason I care is because I’m sick of working on the crappy code left behind by guys who either didn’t invest the time to learn how to code correctly using the tools they had, or lacked the experience to know where to even start. Now that client side development is a thing, it isn’t enough to be able to hack a result together, which is what most full-stack developers are doing who have most of their experience on the back-end. Even otherwise really smart programmers are getting this wrong.  Just because you know JavaScript or TypeScript (or whatever client side language you use that transpiles to JavaScript) doesn’t mean you know how to properly write a client side application that can be maintained, let alone one that can be tested properly!</p>
<h2 id="I’m-Not-The-Only-One"><a href="#I’m-Not-The-Only-One" class="headerlink" title="I’m Not The Only One"></a>I’m Not The Only One</h2><p>I had no idea this was such a hot topic.  I haven’t received this many comments on a blog post in quite a long time.  Some agree.  Others disagree.  All seem pretty passionate in their view.  Many didn’t seem to read the whole article. But here’s the deal, I’m not the only one.  A quick search for “Full Stack Developer Myth” brings up the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//medium.com/swlh/the-full-stack-developer-is-a-myth-4e3fb9c25867">The Full Stack Developer Is a Myth</a></li>
<li><a href="//www.atlanticbt.com/blog/myth-full-stack-unicorn-developer/">The Myth of The Full-Stack Unicorn Developer</a> (love the title)</li>
<li><a href="//andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html">The Myth of the Full-Stack Developer</a></li>
<li><a href="//aquent.com/blog/full-stack-developer-myth">The Myth of the Full Stack Developer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just the first four I could find. To be fair, a small company may think they need to hire someone who can do it all.  But, they’d be better off hiring a “Full-Stack Agency” who has specialist in each area.  Unfortunately, my experience has shown a company who should be using an agency also has no clue about the skill level they should be hiring.</p>
<h2 id="Practical-Reality"><a href="#Practical-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Practical Reality"></a>Practical Reality</h2><p>I’m not sure I have an answer for the dilemma I’ve presented. Show your manager this article? Refuse to take Full Stack jobs? No, I doubt those will work. What I’ve been doing is interviewing for jobs on the strength of what I’m an expert in. It doesn’t always work. But for the companies that recognize that I know way more than most of their developers who are just getting by, this lands me a secure, well-paying place in the dev shop. Spread the word. Full Stack developers don’t really exist. The best developers are specialist and business would do well to hire specialist over generalist.</p>

        <p>I’ve been programming now for 30 years. Over those thirty years, and more so over the last five to ten years, I’ve become increasingly frustrated by the attitude of managers and programmers alike toward programming. One programmer I know is pretty vocal about this attitude.  All he seems to care about is how fast he can write the code.  “I got that application done in a month!”  And then he’ll complain about how it is everyone else’s fault that he spent the next four months fixing bugs. And it is no wonder he has this attitude.  Most of the managers I’ve worked for will acknowledge that there is a lot of technical debt, but the pressure of getting the code written always outweighs the pressure of the debt. I’ve said for years that I’m not at all surprised that software has bugs.  What surprises me most is that any of our code works at all.  If we are honest about our code, we recognize that our code is worse than a store front on the wild west.  A nice facade on the front that everyone sees (if we are lucky) but look behind the facade and the store is barely standing up because the design, architecture and lumber is so bad. But, if it is true that “How you do anything is how you do everything.”  shouldn’t we spend a little time practicing quality in the not so obvious places so that we can get in the habit of quality?  Maybe a culture of quality will rub off into our code and produce code that really does get written quickly and has very little technical debt.  Not just in the area of bugs, but in flexibility, architecture, and design. So, what could we change in our programming practice that wouldn’t require persuading a manager to make a change in how the whole organization worked? [caption id=”attachment_4574” align=”aligncenter” width=”664”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-02-20.jpg" alt="How you do anything..." title="How you do anything..."> Photo on <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/cecba2">Visualhunt</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="How-do-you-Dress"><a href="#How-do-you-Dress" class="headerlink" title="How do you Dress?"></a>How do you Dress?</h2><p>When I first started programming, I had to wear a suit to work.  I forgot my tie one day and actually got reprimanded.  This, despite the fact that the programmers were tucked away in a back room that you had to know existed to get to.  That is, there was no way one of the customers our business worked with was going to find us.  I hated it. The pendulum has in the opposite direction.  I’ve been on several interviews where I’ve explicitly been told to NOT wear a suit. But I do wonder.  Does how we dress have an impact on our code?  If we don’t care much about how WE look, might we not care that much about what our code looks like?  Does it matter?  I think it might. Might it also subconsciously impact other’s view of the quality of code you produce?  You know the adage.  Always dress just below your manager.  But what if your manager dresses like a slob?  Currently, my signature work clothes are black jeans, button down shirt and a sweater.  But, I’m thinking of bumping it up a notch.</p>
<h2 id="What-does-your-desk-look-like"><a href="#What-does-your-desk-look-like" class="headerlink" title="What does your desk look like?"></a>What does your desk look like?</h2><p>There was a guy I worked with early on in my career who always left his desk in a condition that looked like no one had worked at the desk in months.  Everything was put away.  Several years ago, I decided to take on that habit. Funny story.  A couple of gigs ago, a manager from three levels up came down to visit after I had left for the day.  She looked at my desk and said, “Does anyone work here?”  My manager said, “YES!!! Don’t touch anything!”  Guess she was hunting for stray equipment. I would say, this simple act was the pivot point for me when I started to care more about my code beyond “Does it work?” There is something about working in a clean area slightly dressed up.  Other parts of your life follow along for the ride.</p>
<h2 id="Linters"><a href="#Linters" class="headerlink" title="Linters"></a>Linters</h2><p>One of those areas is what your code looks like.  A linter can be configured to enforce style rules on your code.  And can also catch dumb mistakes.  The more I use linters, the more convinced I am everyone should use one. Here is some of the ways you will benefit, even if you are the only one using a linter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your code will always follow the same format.  This will make the code easier to read and understand.</li>
<li>As I mentioned, some rules help catch dumb mistakes before you even run the code.</li>
<li>Just like a clean desk feels inviting, well formatted code feels inviting.  The converse, poorly formatted code, adds to the stress level of working on the code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Learn-Your-Tools"><a href="#Learn-Your-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Learn Your Tools"></a>Learn Your Tools</h2><p>I am amazed at how many places I’ve worked where they expect you to learn a particular tool on the fly.  No training.  “We are now using X on this next project.  Download it and start using it!”  And then they wonder why the project is such a disaster.  Bugs everywhere. Want to look like a rock star?  Want to be the guy the boss ask “what should we do?”  Be the guy who knows that new tool better than anyone else. In the process, you’ll also be the guy who uses the tool the way the people who developed that tool intended it to be used. Here’s a truth I’ve observed.  Everyone wants to use whatever tool they’ve just started using like the last tool they used.  And then, when it doesn’t, the new tool “doesn’t work.”  This one truth has done more to hold our industry back than any other one thing I can point to.</p>
<h2 id="Design-Patterns"><a href="#Design-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Design Patterns"></a>Design Patterns</h2><p>Learn the basic design patterns for your environment.  But go beyond learning the pattern.  Learn why the pattern exist.  What problem does it solve?  Be able to recognize counterfeits.</p>
<h2 id="Architecture"><a href="#Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h2><p>Along with Design Patterns, learn the basics of Architecture.  Here’s a hint.  All good architecture answers the question, “How can I write code that is not dependent on any other code?”  This is one of the reasons I love Functional Programming.  By design, Functional code is not dependent on other code.  Dependencies are passed into the function.  But you can achieve similar objectives using Object Oriented programming languages or even Procedural languages.</p>
<h2 id="Single-Responsibility"><a href="#Single-Responsibility" class="headerlink" title="Single Responsibility"></a>Single Responsibility</h2><p>Granular is better than Monolithic!  Don’t be afraid to split things up.  Use components.  Compose classes of other classes.  Components of other components.  And most important of all, don’t create a Utils class of any kind.  In some languages this is easier than others.  But if you can, any method you have in a Utils class should be a function in its own file.  If you can’t do that, maybe each function belongs in its own class unless there is a strong argument for putting them together in a class that can be reasonably named in a way that obviously groups those methods. Another pet peeve of mine is putting multiple classes or interfaces in one file. Split them up!  Don’t make me go hunting for the source of a class. The ONLY time you might be excused from splitting things up is if the only place the code is being used is in the file’s main class.  But once you make that class available to the outside world, out it comes.</p>
<h2 id="Alternate-Languages"><a href="#Alternate-Languages" class="headerlink" title="Alternate Languages"></a>Alternate Languages</h2><p>This should go without saying.  But the more languages you learn, the better programmer you will become.  I remember when I started learning C++, I had a hard time understanding references.  And then I started learning Clipper (a dBase III compiler) and something they said made references make sense suddenly. And this has been my experience all along.  Every new thing I learn helps me see problems in a slightly different perspective.  Making my code in every language I know that much better.</p>
<h2 id="Code-Reviews"><a href="#Code-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="Code Reviews"></a>Code Reviews</h2><p>So far, everything I’ve mentioned is something you can do on your own.  This last one will require at least one other person.  Maybe you can buddy up with someone at work for this. It amazes me that in 30 years of programming, only three of those years have been in an environment where my code was ever reviewed by someone else.  But getting another set of eyes on your code is helpful if for no other reason than someone else has had to try to understand what you did while you still remember instead of waiting years and you’ve forgotten or moved on.  None of us are as smart as all of us.  Take advantage of another pair of eyes on your code, even if that’s not a formal thing where you currently work.</p>
<h2 id="What-Else"><a href="#What-Else" class="headerlink" title="What Else?"></a>What Else?</h2><p>What else you change the quality of our code by changing our own habits?  Leave a comment.</p>

        <p>Several weeks ago, I mentioned that I’ve been playing around with <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/property-based-testing/">Property Based Testing</a>.  In particular, I’ve been using it with my Angular code.  The framework I’ve chosen is <a href="//github.com/jsverify/jsverify">jsVerify</a> because it seemed like the most straight forward of the available tools and it has a documented way of integrating with Jasmine, which Angular test use by default.  Angular with jsVerify.  How does that work? The documentation for how to use jsVerify seems to be written for people who already understand Property Based Testing from some other environment.  This makes picking it up and using it awkward at best. Here’s what I’ve learned along the way. [caption id=”attachment_4570” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-02-06.jpg" alt="Property Based Testing in Angular with jsVerify" title="Property Based Testing in Angular with jsVerify"> Photo credit: <a href="//visualhunt.com/author/a3b62c">Official U.S. Navy Imagery</a> on <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/d44953">Visual Hunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"> CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h2><p>To install jsVerify into your dev environment, use: <code>npm install --save-dev jsverify</code> To use the code in your spec file, import jsverify using: <code>import * as jsc from &#39;jsverify&#39;;</code> We us ‘jsc’ because jsVerify originated from <a href="//github.com/douglascrockford/JSCheck">jsCheck</a>.  Why not just use jsCheck?  Well, because it looks even less well documented.  That doesn’t mean that it is, but that is how I felt when I went to the sites and I couldn’t be bothered to wade through the wall of text the documentation site presented me with.</p>
<h2 id="A-Simple-Test"><a href="#A-Simple-Test" class="headerlink" title="A Simple Test"></a>A Simple Test</h2><p>Now to setup a simple test.  We won’t really test anything.  I just want to show the structure of the test. There are two methods you might use that seem very similar.  <code>assertForall()</code> and <code>checkForall()</code>.  What I didn’t realize at first is that <code>assertForall()</code> is the one you want to use because it will throw the exception that Jasmine is listening for so that I knows the test failed.  If you use <code>checkForall()</code> the test will fail, but Jasmine will think it succeeded.  And if you’re thinking, yeah but you should use expect() with checkForAll(), that doesn’t always work quite the way you would expect.  No pun intended. The basic structure of a test will go inside of your <code>it()</code> block.</p>
<pre><code>describe(&apos;Any two numeric values&apos;, () =&gt; {
  it(&apos;should equal 20&apos;, () =&gt; {
    jsc.assertForall(jsc.integer, jsc.integer, 
      (a: number, b: number) =&gt; {
        const a_and_b_equal_20 = a + b === 20;
        return a_and_b_equal_20;
    });
  });
});
</code></pre><p>This test will, obviously, fail.  A test we would expect to pass would look like this.</p>
<pre><code>describe(&apos;Any two numeric values&apos;, () =&gt; {
  it(&apos;should be able to be added in any order&apos;, () =&gt; {
    jsc.assertForall(jsc.integer, jsc.integer, 
      (a: number, b: number) =&gt; {
        const a_and_b_equal_20 = a + b === b + a;
        return a_and_b_equal_20;
    });
  });
});
</code></pre><p>You may have guessed by now that <code>assertForall()</code>takes a variable number of parameters.  The last parameter is a callback that runs our test.  The parameters before the callback describe the kinds of parameters that will be passed to the callback.  The description of the parameter is of type Arbitrary.  So, what we’ve said above is something to the effect of, “generate two random integers and pass them to the callback.”  You can check the jsVerify site for “Primitive Arbitraries” to see what is built in.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Complexity"><a href="#Adding-Complexity" class="headerlink" title="Adding Complexity"></a>Adding Complexity</h2><p>It won’t be long before you run into a situation where the primitive arbitraries won’t do the job for you and you’ll need to resort to the combinators.  This allows you to create a brand new arbitrary by combining primitives together.  The one I found myself using the most was <code>oneof()</code> where you pass a list of arbitraries as an array and the system will pick from the list and generate a new random value from the list.  Don’t confuse this with <code>either()</code>.  I’ve used <code>oneof()</code> in combination with <code>constant()</code>for cases where I’ve needed to create a random value from a list of possible values. Where things really got interesting though was when I needed to create an object with random values for the properties.  For this, you’ll need to use a record.</p>
<pre><code>const recordArb = jsc.record({
  firstName: jsc.string,
  lastName: jsc.string,
  arrayThing: jsc.array(jsc.record({
    fieldOne: jsc.integer,
    dateField: jsc.datetime
  }))
});
</code></pre><p>This will let us pass random objects to our tests.  This is great for testing Reducers.  You’ll notice we even were able to create a nested array.  This will create a random length array with random records inside of it.</p>
<h2 id="Arbitraries-from-Generators"><a href="#Arbitraries-from-Generators" class="headerlink" title="Arbitraries from Generators"></a>Arbitraries from Generators</h2><p>Now that I’ve been working with it for a while, I can’t remember why it was so difficult.  But the one place I did have some trouble was the concept of Generators vs Arbitraries.  Arbitraries are what we need to pass into <code>assertForall().</code> Generators are what we use when we need to come up with some way of creating our own special random data.  You rarely need to use this, but when you do, being able to convert the Generator to an Arbitrary will become critical. To convert a generator to an arbitrary, use bless.</p>
<pre><code>jsc.generator.bless(generatorThing);
</code></pre><h2 id="Typing"><a href="#Typing" class="headerlink" title="Typing"></a>Typing</h2><p>As of this writing, the typing for <code>checkForall()</code> is incorrect.  It is typed as returning <code>Result&lt;any&gt;</code>when it in fact returns <code>Result&lt;any&gt; | boolean</code>I just discovered this so I haven’t entered a pull request that will fix the issue.  If you decide to use <code>checkForall()</code> instead of <code>assertForall()</code>, you’ll need to fix up the typings yourself.</p>
<h2 id="Puzzles"><a href="#Puzzles" class="headerlink" title="Puzzles"></a>Puzzles</h2><p>The one thing I’m still trying to figure out is the best way of running the test.  The fact of the matter is that jsVerify tests do not lend themselves to the structure of a Jasmine test.  And since I have to generate 100 instances of random data for each test, it may not be efficient to separate each test out into separate it statements. For now, I’m running all related evaluations within one it statement and using the back-tick string delimiter to allow me to have a multi-line it() string that describes all that I’m testing.  But, by combining all of my test like this, I can no longer determine which of my test actually failed. I’m not exactly sure what the best solution to that is (yet) and right now, there don’t seem to be a lot of people using jsVerify or any other property based framework with Jasmine to get a lot of hints on how we might write tests that are easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I encourage you to give jsVerify a try.  It really isn’t that hard to pick up and hopefully, this short article will smooth over some of the problems you may have as you get started.  Despite the puzzles I mentioned above the advantages of using it over example based testing encourage me to see just how far I can push this framework.</p>

        <p>Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been experimenting with Property Based Testing.  While I’m probably doing it “wrong” by many definitions, I’m finding it useful enough that I’m adding it to my testing toolbox. [caption id=”attachment_4561” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-01-23.jpg" alt="Property Based Testing Revealed - A Better Way to Test" title="Property Based Testing Revealed - A Better Way to Test"> Photo credit: <a href="//visualhunt.com/author/0651d3">abraham.williams</a> on <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/284007">VisualHunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/"> CC BY-SA</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="What’s-A-Property"><a href="#What’s-A-Property" class="headerlink" title="What’s A Property?"></a>What’s A Property?</h2><p>As you introduce yourself to Property Based Testing, one of the first things you’ll need to understand is what they mean by a “property.”  Most of us who have been doing some form of Object Oriented Programming think of “properties” as data points on an object.  That’s not even close to what the word means when we talk about Property Based Testing. Roughly translated, a “property” is some feature of the code under tests.  Most of the beginner literature uses the classic add(a, b) method.  Properties of an add method include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>add(a, b) === add(b, a)</code></li>
<li>if <code>a</code> is zero then <code>add()</code> will return the value of <code>b</code></li>
<li><code>add(a, b) - a</code> will equal b (and similar for minus b equals a).</li>
</ul>
<p>The key here is that we shouldn’t need to know too much about the data we are sending in to our add method because we are going to send in random data.  So, any property we test needs to be expressed in a data agnostic way.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-the-Advantages"><a href="#What-are-the-Advantages" class="headerlink" title="What are the Advantages?"></a>What are the Advantages?</h2><p>And while having to think about our test in a data agnostic way is hard, at first, the first advantage is that we start thinking about testing our code in terms of generalities instead of specifics.  And, really, a general test is a much more robust test. But, we need data for our tests, right?  Where does that come from?  Depending on the framework you are using, this may vary, but the general idea is that you describe what the data should look like, and the framework will generate random parameters to pass in.  This fact leads us to two more benefits of Property Based Testing. First, since all I need to do is describe what the data should look like, I’m not forced to think of the data I want to use to tests my function.  I don’t know about you, but my tendency is to create data that works with my function instead of trying to create data that will break my function.  By having the framework create random data, I’m more likely to test with data that will break my code. And that leads to the second benefit of random data.  I’m more likely to find the edge cases for my function under test. Now, one detail I’ve left out is that each test you create gets run multiple times with different random data.  So, it isn’t like one day your tests work great and another day they fail.  No.  The system I use generates 100 different sets of data per tests.  You can have it create more or less tests as needed.</p>
<h2 id="Places-You-Might-Not-Use-Property-Based-Testing"><a href="#Places-You-Might-Not-Use-Property-Based-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Places You Might Not Use Property Based Testing"></a>Places You Might Not Use Property Based Testing</h2><p>Now, running 100 different permutations on a test that takes a long time to run may not be practical.  My first question would be, why does your code take that long?  Are you trying to unit test HTML code and the rendering is taking a long time?  That’s probably a poor use case. Another place where you might want to avoid property based tests is when you’ve already basically tested the component parts and you just need to do a sanity check in the integration of the parts.</p>
<h2 id="Places-You-Might-Use-Property-Based-Testing-Anyhow"><a href="#Places-You-Might-Use-Property-Based-Testing-Anyhow" class="headerlink" title="Places You Might Use Property Based Testing Anyhow"></a>Places You Might Use Property Based Testing Anyhow</h2><p>On the other hand, not having to come up with my own parameter values makes the whole Property Based Testing pretty attractive, even when it doesn’t make a lot of sense.  And it might encourage you to write smaller functions.</p>
<h2 id="Problems-I’ve-Run-Into"><a href="#Problems-I’ve-Run-Into" class="headerlink" title="Problems I’ve Run Into"></a>Problems I’ve Run Into</h2><p>I would say the biggest problem I’ve run into using Property Based Testing is learning how to write tests that don’t re-implement the logic in my code in order to test the logic in my code. Going back to the <code>add(a, b)</code> example above.  It is tempting to test that function by verifying that <code>add(a, b) === a + b</code>.  But that wouldn’t be a very good test because we used the same logic that is probably already being used inside the <code>add()</code> function.  In example based testing (classic unit testing), we have the same problem, we just don’t use code to implement it.  We add the numbers in our head and verify that <code>add(a, b) = c</code>.  But, <code>c</code> is just <code>a + b</code> done in our head. Which leads me back to, even though it is “harder” we end up with better tests.</p>
<h2 id="I’m-Probably-Doing-it-Wrong"><a href="#I’m-Probably-Doing-it-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="I’m Probably Doing it Wrong"></a>I’m Probably Doing it Wrong</h2><p>I’m so new to this way of thinking, that I’m pretty sure I’m doing everything wrong.  But, I figure I can take advantage of what I understand and as I write more tests, I’ll find more and better ways of writing tests.  I encourage you to pick up a property based framework for your development environment and give it a try.</p>

        <p>I recently reviewed some Angular code that uses one module.  The AppModule. To manage the entire code base.  And, this isn’t tiny code base.  The main excuse I’ve heard for this is that the code originated during the beta cycle, prior to NgModule being added to the framework.  I call it out as an excuse because once it was added, it was clear that we needed to have more than one module.  The fact that this code base doesn’t have more than one module shows a disregard for doing things right over doing things fast.  In the best case, it shows ignorance. But, the larger question this code base raises for me is this: “Why are more modules better than fewer modules?”  After all, using one module obviously works.  Isn’t the fact that it works sufficient enough? And here are three really good reasons to use more modules. [caption id=”attachment_4550” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-01-16-1.jpg" alt="Why more Angular Modules are Better than One" title="Why more Angular Modules are Better than One"> Photo credit: <a href="//visualhunt.com/author/1d5a2d">goodrob13</a> on <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/0a04dc">Visualhunt.com</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"> CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Avoid-Component-Collision"><a href="#Avoid-Component-Collision" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Component Collision"></a>Avoid Component Collision</h2><p>For discussion purposes, let’s say you have an application with two routes.  Each route allows you to edit different kinds of content.  You may be inclined to create some child components in each route to assist with your functionality.  In the process of doing this, you may end up with two components that have the same name.  Both as a class and as a selector.  If you are including everything in one mega module, you will need to artificially give the components different names.  However, if each route has its own module, you can declare the components in the declaration section of each module with the same name and each route will be able to call the appropriate component.  Components aren’t shared across modules until you export the component.  In that case, you would also want the component to live in a shared module where we would give it a more meaningful, generic, name that made sense as a shared module.</p>
<h2 id="Lazy-Loading"><a href="#Lazy-Loading" class="headerlink" title="Lazy Loading"></a>Lazy Loading</h2><p>Once you’ve created modules for each of your routes, the next logical step in your development effort will be lazy loading the module.  Lazy loading provides more advantages than just the ability to load only what you need when you need it.  That’s just the most obvious gain.  Lazy loading also provides a separate context for @Injectables.  Once again, just like having the ability to isolate the components, by using modules in conjunction with lazy loading, we have the ability to have route specific @Injectables with the same name and each route/module will behave appropriately. There is one caveat.  You can’t provide an @Injectable in a lazy loaded module and an application level module and expect things to work correctly.  And, if you are still using a framework like NgRX 2 that needs to have access to services, you’ll need to make your services globally available.  This is one of many reasons why I believe you should upgrade to NgRX 4 as soon as is possible.  This allows you to take full advantage of the Angular Lazy Loading capabilities and all their benefits.</p>
<h2 id="Cleaner-Code"><a href="#Cleaner-Code" class="headerlink" title="Cleaner Code"></a>Cleaner Code</h2><p>Even if you’ve never seen a major application with one module, I’m sure you can imagine what a mess that module is.  I don’t think I really need to say much more about this. For more on Angular Modules, I recommend <a href="//angular.io/guide/ngmodule-faq">this FAQ that the Angular team put together</a>. <a href="//medium.com/@cyrilletuzi/understanding-angular-modules-ngmodule-and-their-scopes-81e4ed6f7407">This Medium article</a> is also pretty good.</p>

        <p>This past week I implemented a pattern I’ve been pondering for almost a year now.  I like to create rather modular and granular code such that if my data structures are nested, the components that represent them on the screen should be nested as well. The question becomes, how does one create a reactive form in a child component and attach that form to the parent form in a way that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leaves the definition of the child form entirely in the child</li>
<li>Leaves the processing of the data in the parent where the parent form is the “Smart Component” and the child is a “Dumb Component”</li>
</ol>
<p>Most solutions I was able to find attack this problem assuming the child component will be part of an array of controls.  And I suppose, if you wanted to, you could implement that pattern using an array with one element.  But, that just felt like a hack.  If you are interested in that solution, this is the wrong article.

<h2 id="Avoiding-the-Problem"><a href="#Avoiding-the-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Avoiding the Problem"></a>Avoiding the Problem</h2><p>Up until recently, I’ve been able to avoid this problem entirely by creating separate forms and listening to each individually.  I could have done the same thing here.  But, every time I use this solution, I feel like there must be a better way.  Besides, when you do this correctly, you only need to have one place where you are listening for changes to the form and one place where you send changes into the form.  The work around requires multiples of each.</p>
<h2 id="Basics-of-Nested-Forms"><a href="#Basics-of-Nested-Forms" class="headerlink" title="Basics of Nested Forms"></a>Basics of Nested Forms</h2><p>Another way of avoiding the problem is to create the form as one monolithic component.  A very simple implementation would be to have a form that looked something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form [formGroup]=&quot;form&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; formControlName=&quot;mainInput&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div formGroupName=&quot;childGroup&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; formControlName=&quot;childInput&quot;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre><p>And the reactive definition in the typescript that looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>export class AppComponent {
  form: FormGroup;
  constructor(formBuilder: FormBuilder) {
    this.form = formBuilder.group({
      mainInput: &apos;&apos;,
      childGroup: formBuilder.group({
        childInput: &apos;&apos;
      })
    });
  }
}
</code></pre><p>And then we would grab the data from the valueChanges observable or patch the data into the form using <code>childGroup.childInput</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-the-Child-Component"><a href="#Creating-the-Child-Component" class="headerlink" title="Creating the Child Component"></a>Creating the Child Component</h2><p>But what if you we want everything in the childGroup to be a control?  That control would look something like this: <code>&lt;div [formGroup]=&quot;form&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; formControlName=&quot;childInput&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code> and then our TypeScript code looks like a normal formGroup:</p>
<pre><code>this.form = formBuilder.group({
  childInput: &apos;&apos;
});
</code></pre><h2 id="Embedding-the-Child-in-the-Parent"><a href="#Embedding-the-Child-in-the-Parent" class="headerlink" title="Embedding the Child in the Parent"></a>Embedding the Child in the Parent</h2><p>Now that we have a separate component for our child form, we can use normal directives to add it into our main form.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form [formGroup]=&quot;form&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; formControlName=&quot;mainInput&quot;&gt;
  &lt;app-child&gt;
  &lt;/app-child&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre><p>And our TypeScript code now only needs a reference to mainInput.</p>
<pre><code>constructor(formBuilder: FormBuilder) {
  this.form = formBuilder.group({
    mainInput: &apos;&apos;
  });
}
</code></pre><h2 id="Connecting-the-Child-to-the-Parent"><a href="#Connecting-the-Child-to-the-Parent" class="headerlink" title="Connecting the Child to the Parent"></a>Connecting the Child to the Parent</h2><p>The problem is, whenever the childInput element changes, the parent form’s valueChanges observer won’t get notified because the parent form no longer knows about the child form.  And this is where things interesting. Hooking the child form to the parent form is actually pretty straight forward.  The trick is knowing when in the component life-cycle to run the code. The first thing to know is that we aren’t going to be able to hookup the child in the parent until after the child component has been created.  This happens after ngOnInit() so we need to find another lifecycle hook to wire everything up in.  It just so happens that ngAfterViewInit() is the perfect place for this. Second, it might be tempting to hookup everything in the child component during it’s ngOnInit() method.  But this would too tightly couple the child component to the parent.  Something we would like to avoid. So, the next thing we need to do is that we need to use @ViewChild() to allow the parent to get a hold of the child component, and ultimately the formGroup member variable it will initialize for us.</p>
<pre><code>@ViewChild(ChildComponent) childComponent: ChildComponent;
</code></pre><p>And now in <code>ngAfterViewInit()</code> we can add the child’s <code>FormGroup</code> as an additional “control” and set the parent <code>FormGroup</code> to the parent control’s <code>FormGroup</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ngAfterViewInit() {
  this.form.addControl(&apos;childForm&apos;, this.childComponent.form);
  this.childComponent.form.setParent(this.form);
}
</code></pre><p>And finally, you’ll want to subscribe to <code>valueChanges</code> and your NgRX <code>Store</code> in <code>ngAfterViewInit()</code> after this wire-up code.</p>

        <p>This past week I had my first need to do use cross field validation in Angular.  While the general mechanics are pretty trivial, my particular implementation ran into some issues that you might be interested in. [caption id=”attachment_4529” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-19.jpg" alt="Angular Cross Field Validation" title="Angular Cross Field Validation"> Photo by <a href="//visualhunt.com/author/525a6d">MSVG</a> on <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/2a53de">VisualHunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"> CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h2><p>As I said, the mechanics of implementing cross field validation in Angular is rather trivial.  It all hinges on the concept of a FieldGroup which is a key concept of <a href="//blog.dmbcllc.com/tag/reactive-forms/">Reactive Forms</a>. What we need to do to implement cross field validation is to attach a validation function to the form instead of the field. I’m going to use the AppComponent to host the FormBuilder for simplicity:</p>
<p><code>export class AppComponent {</code></p>
<p><code>form:FormGroup;</code></p>
<p><code>constructor(formBuilder: FormBuilder) {</code></p>
<p><code>this.form=formBuilder.group({</code></p>
<p><code>// form field definitions here</code></p>
<p><code>}, {</code></p>
<p><code>validator: AppComponent.formGroupValidationFunction</code></p>
<p><code>});</code></p>
<p> <code>}</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>You’ll notice that <code>formBuilder.group()</code> takes a second parameter which takes a <code>validator</code> function or function array.  This parameter can also the <code>asyncValidator</code> key or the <code>state</code> key. The function we are pointing to takes the <code>FormGroup</code> as a parameter.  So, within the function, we can access the controls that are part of the <code>FormGroup</code>.  Once we have the fields, we can access the values of the fields and perform whatever comparisons we need, which is pretty trivial.  Then, if there is an error, we call setError() on the control(s) that are impacted.</p>
<p><code>static formGroupValidationFunction(formGroup: FormGroup):void {</code></p>
<p><code>constfield1=formGroup.controls[&#39;field1&#39;];</code></p>
<p><code>constfield2=formGroup.controls[&#39;field2&#39;];</code></p>
<p><code>// compare field1 to field2</code></p>
<p><code>if(error) {</code></p>
<p><code>field1.setError({formGroupValidationFunction:true});</code></p>
<p><code>field2.setError({formGroupValidationFunction:true});</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<h2 id="Dealing-with-Field-Validations"><a href="#Dealing-with-Field-Validations" class="headerlink" title="Dealing with Field Validations"></a>Dealing with Field Validations</h2><p>One of the problems I ran into was that my fields also had individual validations on them.  Specifically, the two fields were numbers that I was validating to make sure they were positive and only displayed two decimal places.  By the time I entered the validation for the FormGroup, that validation had already run.  I also wanted to clear any pre-existing errors from my form validation. It turns out that the way Angular determines if there is an error is if the forms errors object exist.  If it is null, it is assumed there aren’t any errors. So, to clear the pre-existing errors, the safest thing to do is to first delete the error I was adding from each field, and then check to see if there are any other errors in the errors object.  If there aren’t any errors, we then call <code>setError(null)</code> to clear out the error object.</p>
<p><code>if(field1.errors&amp;&amp;field1.errors.formGroupValidationFunction) {</code></p>
<p><code>deletefield1.errors.formGroupValidationFunction;</code></p>
<p><code>if(Object.keys(field1.errors).length===0) {</code></p>
<p><code>field1.setErrors(null);</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>When adding the <code>FormGroup</code> error, we only call <code>setError()</code> if the errors object is null.</p>
<p><code>if(!field1.errors) {</code></p>
<p><code>field1.setError({ formGroupValidationFunction:true });</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>By doing this, we ensure that the field validation errors aren’t overwritten by the <code>FormGroup</code> validations.</p>
<h2 id="Alternatives"><a href="#Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives"></a>Alternatives</h2><p>The code I’ve shown works well enough if you only have a one-off validation.  But in my case, I needed to use the validation between multiple sets of fields.  To do this, I created a function that returns another function. The outer function takes two parameters.  Strings that are keys into the controls of the form group.  So, now instead of:</p>
<p><code>constructor(formBuilder:FormBuilder) {</code></p>
<p><code>this.form=formBuilder.group({</code></p>
<p><code>// form stuff here</code></p>
<p><code>}, {</code></p>
<p><code>validator:formGroupValidationFunctionHere</code></p>
<p><code>});</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>I have:</p>
<p><code>constructor(formBuilder:FormBuilder) {</code></p>
<p><code>this.form=formBuilder.group({</code></p>
<p><code>// form stuff here</code></p>
<p><code>}, {</code></p>
<p><code>validator:formGroupValidationFunction(&#39;field1&#39;, &#39;field2&#39;)</code></p>
<p><code>});</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>And my validation function looks something like this:</p>
<p><code>static formGroupValidationFunction(f1: string, f2: string): Function {</code></p>
<p><code>return (formGroup: FormGroup): void =&gt; {</code></p>
<p><code>constfield1=formGroup.controls[f1];</code></p>
<p><code>constfield2=formGroup.controls[f2];</code></p>
<p><code>// compare field1 to field2</code></p>
<p><code>if(error) {</code></p>
<p><code>field1.setError({formGroupValidationFunction: true});</code></p>
<p><code>field2.setError({formGroupValidationFunction: true});</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>You’ll notice that my <code>setError()</code> uses the name of the function as the error key.  I just do this for clarity.  You CAN name it whatever you want.  I name it the same to be consistent with how the Angular validations work. Finally, I like to put my custom validations in a separate Static Class rather than including them in the component code.  I’ve only placed them in the component code here for illustrative purposes.</p>

        <p>We all know about best practices.  But what does it take to really mess up a project?  Well, for starters, you do EVERYTHING wrong.  You don’t just ignore one or two best practices, you ignore them all.  By evaluating the mess you can get yourself into by ignoring best practices, I think we can all learn better why these recommendations exist. [caption id=”attachment_4524” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-12.png" alt="How to Really Screw Up an Angular Project" title="How to Really Screw Up an Angular Project"> Photo on <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/f81060">VisualHunt</a>[/caption]</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Use-the-CLI"><a href="#Don’t-Use-the-CLI" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Use the CLI"></a>Don’t Use the CLI</h2><p>I can grant a pass if you aren’t using the Angular CLI because you started your project before the CLI became viable.  But, by this point you should have already converted your project over to use the CLI or be making plans to move to the CLI. Why is this a problem? Because 99% of the developers you are going to find will expect that when you ask for an Angular developer, what you mean is that you are looking for someone who can write Angular code using the Angular CLI.  This brings with is a certain number of expectations about how your code is laid out.  Some of these are outlined below.  But just as a way of generalizing, if your code doesn’t look like it started as an Angular CLI project, you are going to slow down any future developers you hire.</p>
<h2 id="Ignore-Naming-Conventions"><a href="#Ignore-Naming-Conventions" class="headerlink" title="Ignore Naming Conventions"></a>Ignore Naming Conventions</h2><p>Ignoring naming conventions may seem trivial, but naming conventions add clarity.  The reason we name component files as components is so we know they are all part of a component.  Reducer file names should be named <code>foo-bar.reducer.ts</code>.  Not naming the files in a way that is clear reduces the ability to maintain the code in a clear and efficient way. Maybe you’ve come up with your own naming conventions for your organization.  This is better.  But still this is not best.  This means that you probably won’t be able to use the CLI to scaffold out your code and any future developer is going to have to learn your way of writing Angular instead of the industry standard way of writing Angular. But the absolute worst thing you can do is to not have any standard or to mix standards.  This is confusing and just looks ugly.</p>
<h2 id="Cluster-Code-by-Function-Instead-of-Feature"><a href="#Cluster-Code-by-Function-Instead-of-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Cluster Code by Function Instead of Feature"></a>Cluster Code by Function Instead of Feature</h2><p>The other thing you might be tempted to do is to cluster your code by function.  That is, you might want to group all of your components together.  And then all your services under another folder.  Maybe put your reducers under one folder and your effects under another. Trust me, this just adds fuel to the argument that “NgRX is confusing”.  Group all your similar NgRX code together and put all of your code together grouped by feature.  If you’ve named the files correctly, you won’t need the directories to keep things sorted out and you won’t be forced to use one module for your entire project.</p>
<h2 id="Use-one-Module"><a href="#Use-one-Module" class="headerlink" title="Use one Module"></a>Use one Module</h2><p>Maybe you don’t know any better.  Or maybe it is because you’ve violated the rules above.  But no matter the reason, if you end up putting all your imports, providers, and declarations in your app module, you’ll soon see just how ugly this looks.  One for the whole application violates the single responsibility principle.  You want a module per feature at the very least.  I often create modules just to provide an additional level of granularity that further implements the single responsibility principle.</p>
<h2 id="No-Lazy-Loading"><a href="#No-Lazy-Loading" class="headerlink" title="No Lazy Loading"></a>No Lazy Loading</h2><p>Yes, even if your application has only one route.  You want to lazy load your code so that a different bundle gets created for each route.  Done well, you can make changes to one route without impacting any of the others.  When you deploy the new code, your end user should only have to reload the route(s) that changed.  Without lazy loading, when you redeploy, they’ll have to reload an entirely new set of files.</p>
<h2 id="Embed-Colors-and-Fonts-in-Component-CSS"><a href="#Embed-Colors-and-Fonts-in-Component-CSS" class="headerlink" title="Embed Colors and Fonts in Component CSS"></a>Embed Colors and Fonts in Component CSS</h2><p>You should have a theme file, or an application level CSS file that defines the fonts, and colors that should be used throughout your application.  The only CSS that should be included at the component level is CSS that is necessary to layout the html within the component.  That is, position information.  If you are putting color information in, or specifying a font size or font, you are probably doing it wrong. Why is this an issue.  Well, let’s suppose that someone decides that all of your warnings should be a different color.  If you can make that change in one CSS file, that is going to be a lot easier than looking through all the CSS in all of your components to make sure you found every place the color needs to be changed. Don’t repeat yourself makes just as much sense in CSS as anywhere else in your code.</p>
<h2 id="Mix-Template-Files-and-Strings"><a href="#Mix-Template-Files-and-Strings" class="headerlink" title="Mix Template Files and Strings"></a>Mix Template Files and Strings</h2><p>As you should know by now, you can create the HTML templates and the CSS templates either by using strings in the TS file or by using separate HTML and CSS files.  You should use one style and use it consistently.  I’ve seen one project where they were using a mix of both and they had at least one file that was using a string for the HTML but still had the HTML file next to the TS and CSS file.  That’s just confusing.  Don’t do that!</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Remove-Dead-Code"><a href="#Don’t-Remove-Dead-Code" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Remove Dead Code"></a>Don’t Remove Dead Code</h2><p>As we work on code, we might create a variable, or use an import that no longer is needed.  The linter is really good about telling us what code is no longer needed.  Use it and keep you code cleaned up.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Stay-Up-to-Date"><a href="#Don’t-Stay-Up-to-Date" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Stay Up to Date"></a>Don’t Stay Up to Date</h2><p>Angular is progressing at a pretty fast rate and the Angular CLI is as well.  I realize that it isn’t always possible to keep the version you are working on up to date with the latest tools.  But not keeping your tools up to date for several months at a time is also something you want to avoid.  The sooner you update, the easier the update will be. Will the update break something?  Yes, that is likely.  You should plan that into your work flow.  Otherwise, you’ll get to the point where it will take so long to update, you’ll never get approval to do it because it will take too long.</p>

        <p>I’ve noticed a pattern in the programming world at large both with programmers and with managers.  We define things how we want them to be for our organization and not how they are.  We are like Humpty Dumpty who says, “When I use a word … it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.” There are two places where I see this pattern manifesting.  The Agile movement and Design Patterns. [caption id=”attachment_4519” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”]<img src="//blog.dmbcllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-05.png" alt="Humpty Dumpty and Programming" title="Humpty Dumpty and Programming"> Photo by <a href="//visualhunt.com/author/f31767">aturkus</a> on <a href="//visualhunt.com/re/b4881b">Visualhunt</a> / <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"> CC BY</a>[/caption] </p>
<h2 id="Agile"><a href="#Agile" class="headerlink" title="Agile"></a>Agile</h2><p>Longtime readers are familiar with my rants against the failure of Agile.  Ever job interview I go to eventually ends up asking the same question. “Have you ever worked in an Agile organization before?” I have a lot of issues with this question, but my answer is always the same.  “I’ve worked in several organizations that call themselves Agile, but I’ve yet to work in one that really is.”  And there is the problem.  Even if I say I’ve worked in an Agile organization, there is no possible way you can be sure I’ve worked in an Agile organization that defines Agile the way you describe Agile.  So, why even ask the question? It is like Humpty Dumpty trying to explain the meaning of the poem <a href="//www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html">Jabberwocky</a>. We define Agile with the bits we like and ignore the bits we don’t like or don’t understand, like the 4 blind men “looking” at an elephant and then wonder why it doesn’t really work for our organization. Next time someone ask me that question, I may just answer the question with another question, “Why do you ask?” or “How do you define ‘Agile’?” Seriously! What’s the point of asking the question when it doesn’t tell you anything about the applicant you are interviewing?  Agile has become such a major buzzword that I doubt you’ll find any applicants that haven’t worked in an organization that calls itself “Agile.”</p>
<h2 id="Design-Patterns"><a href="#Design-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Design Patterns"></a>Design Patterns</h2><p>The more popular the design pattern, the more likely we are to see the exact same issues in our programming.  Currently, we can most clearly see this in the MV<em> design pattern.  Here again, people are using the design pattern based on what they imagine it to be. In an article I wrote several months ago, someone recently commented about MVVM, “Isn’t that the way MVVM works? views haven’t business login, only pure “view” logic, the ViewModel is the one having business logic.” This is a common misconception.  That the ViewModel, or the Controller, or the Presenter (MVP) are where our business logic go.  This completely ignores the fact that MV</em> is a View layer design pattern.  The View part of the MV* is the part within the larger View layer that is responsible for rendering state.</p>
<h2 id="A-Community-of-Hacks"><a href="#A-Community-of-Hacks" class="headerlink" title="A Community of Hacks?"></a>A Community of Hacks?</h2><p>Are we just a community of hacks?  I think maybe we are. All we care about is that we’ve shipped some code. We, largely, don’t care about our craft.  If we were artist, we starve.  Not because artist starve (which is a myth by the way) but because the code we produce is so crappy, no one would consider it valuable. If we built houses, we’d never get past the building inspectors.  If we were architects, the houses would never get built because the plans are too confusing. The blessing and the curse of programming is that we can change things quickly.  Because we can change things quickly, this has us believing there is no need to be careful. Each year we need more and more programmers to work on code because the codebase becomes crappier each year.  No one cares.  In the 30 years I’ve been programming, I’ve only had my code reviewed as a practice in two organizations.  That alone should tell you something about the state of our code.  And for all the claims about being Agile, none have used any best practices that grew out of Extreme Programming!</p>
<h2 id="What-If"><a href="#What-If" class="headerlink" title="What If?"></a>What If?</h2><p>In previous post I’ve explored both sides of the technical interview process.  Up until recently, the technical interviews focused on the language, the framework, the tools.  And we try to develop an interview process that assures us that the applicant can actually use those tools.  Then when we hire them, and they can’t actually code. We wonder why? What if we got beyond tools to how people think?</p>
<h2 id="Code-Puzzles"><a href="#Code-Puzzles" class="headerlink" title="Code Puzzles"></a>Code Puzzles</h2><p>Recently, I’ve been challenging myself with coding puzzles that are typically used at places like Google, Facebook and Amazon.  Problems that get at issues such as BigO notation, Binary Trees,  Memoization and much more.  I’m doing this for several reasons.  First, working on problems like this reminds me that I’m really not all that smart.  Oh, I can get by, but I don’t challenge myself to produce the best code possible.  Maybe the rant above is more about me than the industry, but I don’t think so.  I think I’ve risen (or more accurately, sunk) to the level of the people I’m surrounded by who themselves are only as high as the people they’ve been working with. I’m also doing these problems because being able to do them will inform my code.  Maybe I’ll never actually need to know about depth first vs breath first searches of a binary tree, but if I can do those problems, I will have additional tools in my toolbox when I code the mundane things.  And finally, these kinds of problems almost always have edge cases I don’t see.  I really need to get better at discovering edge cases before my clients do. And now, here’s the big question.  If these are the kind of questions that Google, Facebook, Amazon and others are using, what do they know that other companies don’t?  Could it be that hiring programmers that can answer these kinds of questions not only ensures that the quality of the code is better, but is actually cheaper in the long run?  Why not hire programmers who are a dime a dozen and can get the job done, but produce crappy code in the process?  I mean, if code quality doesn’t matter like most of our industry thinks, why do these successful companies not just go hire warm bodies?</p>
<h2 id="The-Advantage"><a href="#The-Advantage" class="headerlink" title="The Advantage"></a>The Advantage</h2><p>The advantage to hiring based on how people think rather than on what tools they know is that when the tools change, it won’t matter to the developer who can think through these tougher issues.  On the other hand, those who can’t won’t be able to grasp some of the newer concepts that show up in newer tools.  I’ve seen this first hand as I’ve tried to explain NgRX, RxJS and Functional Programming generally to some of my peers.  Are they difficult concepts.  Sure they are! Are they worth learning? Absolutely!</p>
<h2 id="Be-Intentional"><a href="#Be-Intentional" class="headerlink" title="Be Intentional"></a>Be Intentional</h2><p>So, what’s the point of all of this?  Mostly, be intentional. Don’t coast. Learn everything you can about your craft. Do you really know what MVC, MVVM, MVP, etc are and how they work or are you just working off of what someone else has told you? Do you really know what Agile is? How many design patterns do you know that aren’t the hot new trend? Could you code your way out of an interview with Google, Facebook or Amazon? Where do you want to be with your career next year?  In 5 years? Are you average or striving to be awesome? Join me on the journey!</p>
