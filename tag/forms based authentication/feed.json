The wizard is self explanatory, so I won’t repeat it here except to say that you’ll want to enter your connection information to connect to the server you just created your database on, not one of your databases locally.</p>\n<p>Next you’ll need to add the connection information to your web.config file for the application you are setting up Forms Based Authentication for.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight xml\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">connectionStrings</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"> <span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">remove</span> <span class=\"attr\">name</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;LocalSqlServer&quot;</span>/&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"> <span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">add</span> <span class=\"attr\">name</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;LocalSqlServer&quot;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">  <span class=\"attr\">connectionString</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;Data Source=sqlserverGoesHere;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\"><span class=\"tag\">    Initial Catalog=YourDatabaseName;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\"><span class=\"tag\">    Persist Security Info=True;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\"><span class=\"tag\">    User ID=YourSqlUserID;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\"><span class=\"tag\">    password=YourSqlPassword&quot;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">  <span class=\"attr\">providerName</span>=<span class=\"string\">&quot;System.Data.SqlClient&quot;</span>/&gt;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"name\">connectionStrings</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>The “remove” element is needed because typically the machine.config file on the server has its own entry that you won’t be using.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you’ll need to create your own UI for adding users and assigning them to roles.  It isn’t that hard to do and once you’ve done it you can move the administration controls from project to project.  If I were you, I’d create the control set once in a special sub-directory so that I could move it from project to project.</p>\n",
