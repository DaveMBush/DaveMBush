That is, until .NET 2.0</p>\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\n<p>Even though .NET 2.0 has been out for a while, I would bet that few VB.NET programmers know about this new feature because it is one of those things most of us have grown to assume is not possible. Values must have content–objects don’t.  That’s just the way it is.  If we were to create an integer for example and then tried to assign a nothing to it, we would most certainly get a compiler error.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight vb\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">Dim</span> i <span class=\"keyword\">As</span> <span class=\"type\">Integer</span> i = <span class=\"literal\">Nothing</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>However, the Nullable generic was added so that we can create a VB.NET Nullable Integer</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight vb\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">Dim</span> i <span class=\"keyword\">As</span> Nullable(<span class=\"keyword\">Of</span> <span class=\"type\">Integer</span>)</span><br><span class=\"line\">i = <span class=\"literal\">Nothing</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>And by simply putting a question mark at the end of our variable name, we can shorten the syntax to</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight vb\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">Dim</span> i? <span class=\"keyword\">As</span> <span class=\"type\">Integer</span> i = <span class=\"literal\">Nothing</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n",
