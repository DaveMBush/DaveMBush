            "content_html": "<p><img src=\"/uploads/2015/03/NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList.png\" alt=\"NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList\" title=\"NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList\"></p>\n<p>Several weeks ago now, I started learning <a href=\"//nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a>.  Why?  Well, for a couple of reasons.  First, all the cool kids are using Node.js.  Second, I wanted to use <a href=\"//gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/\">Istanbul</a> to get an idea of how well my javascript code is covered by test and that runs under Node.js.  Third, <a href=\"//blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2015/03/19/customize-external-web-tools-in-visual-studio-2015.aspx\">Node.js is going to show up in the next version of Visual Studio</a>.  And finally, I just like to learn new stuff.</p>\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\n<h2 id=\"Node-JS\"><a href=\"#Node-JS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Node.JS\"></a>Node.JS</h2><p>So, I started by installing node and just working in Visual Studio as though my node project was a web site.  It works, but it isn’t pretty.  But it did get me familiar with some basic concepts like using the node package manager (npm) to install what I needed to get Istanbul running.  For those of you who aren’t familiar with npm, it is basically NuGet for node.js.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Istanbul-JavaScript-Code-Coverage\"><a href=\"#Istanbul-JavaScript-Code-Coverage\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Istanbul JavaScript Code Coverage\"></a>Istanbul JavaScript Code Coverage</h2><p>For those of you who are interested, I used the instructions <a href=\"//ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/10/code-coverage-of-jasmine-tests-using-istanbul-and-karma.html\">here</a> for getting Istanbul working locally.  They should probably be updated because the example there doesn’t have a good configuration example.  I filled in the rest of what I needed to know from the <a href=\"//karma-runner.github.io/0.12/\">Karma site</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Node-for-Visual-Studio\"><a href=\"#Node-for-Visual-Studio\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Node for Visual Studio\"></a>Node for Visual Studio</h2><p>So then I had heard that work was being done on a plugin for Visual Studio 2013 that would allow me to work on Node projects from within Visual Studio.  I found out about this first from <a href=\"//www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingNodejsToolsForVisualStudio.aspx\">Scott Hanselman’s blog</a>.</p>\n<p>So I went  to the <a href=\"//nodejstools.codeplex.com/\">plugin site</a> and got the download and installed it.  This is all pretty straight forward.  Don’t forget, you’ll ALSO need to install node.  So, don’t forget that step.</p>\n<p>OK.  Now that you have the NTVS installed (that’s what they call the plugin) what do you have? Well, you have several new project templates that you can use.  That’s what.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2015/03/NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList1.png\" alt=\"NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList\" title=\"NodeJsInVisualStudioProjectList\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Interactive-JavaScript\"><a href=\"#Interactive-JavaScript\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Interactive JavaScript\"></a>Interactive JavaScript</h2><p>But that’s not all you get, you also get an interactive Node.js window that you can get to from the Tools menu (Tools –&gt; Node.js Tools –&gt; Node.js Interactive window) or by pressing the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+K, N.  Inside this window you can execute JavaScript on the fly: <img src=\"/uploads/2015/03/NodeJsInteractiveWindow.png\" alt=\"NodeJsInteractiveWindow\" title=\"NodeJsInteractiveWindow\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Node-Package-Manager-in-Visual-Studio\"><a href=\"#Node-Package-Manager-in-Visual-Studio\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Node Package Manager in Visual Studio\"></a>Node Package Manager in Visual Studio</h2><p>Or install other node packages:</p>\n<p>.npm install yourPackageNameHere</p>\n<p>Don’t forget the leading period.  That’s the indication to the window that it needs to do something different from executing javascript in the window.</p>\n<p>Even as I’m writing this, I’m seeing that there is a lot more here than I’m actually telling you now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Starting-a-New-Project\"><a href=\"#Starting-a-New-Project\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Starting a New Project\"></a>Starting a New Project</h2><p>Now, the best way of learning something is by creating some kind of product.  Even if it is for your own use.  So, the next thing I did was to try to create a project.  I have a specific project in mind that should use MongoDB for the database (I’ve been meaning to learn NoSQL for a while now) and since Express seems to come with NTVS, I guess I’ll use that for my web server.  Oh and Angular for the front end.</p>\n<p>Since I was creating a web site, I thought, I should create a new web project that uses node.  In fact, it shows up  in the list of web sites types that you can create.  However, I got an error when I did that, and I don’t see anything in the documentation that says I should be able to use those templates or that I need anything extra to use them.</p>\n<p>However, if you use the project options, you can create a web application.  I decided going with newer is better than older, so I’ve created a “Basic Node.js Express 4 Application”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Fun-Is-Just-Beginning\"><a href=\"#The-Fun-Is-Just-Beginning\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Fun Is Just Beginning\"></a>The Fun Is Just Beginning</h2><p>And now, this is where the fun begins.  Where’s my HTML?  What’s all this “template” stuff?  And how do I install Angular?  Or do I do that manually since it isn’t a server side thing? So much to learn.  But, that’s for another post.</p>\n",
