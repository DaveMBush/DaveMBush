If you need to do an update, you will need to store that some place so that your test code can verify that it got passed down to the function that should have saved it to the database.</p>\n<p>By doing this, you can verify that your code from the presentation layer down to this seam works as it should.  Now we need to test the bottom half of our code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Test-the-bottom-half\"><a href=\"#Test-the-bottom-half\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Test the bottom half\"></a>Test the bottom half</h2><p>This will be a bit easier.  What we do here is we have our test code run the code directly.  But, unlike when we run the code in production, we will wrap the code in transaction tracking starting with our setup method.  We turn on transaction tracking, get the database into the state that we need for testing, run our test, and then rollback the changes.  Assuming the transaction tracking works correctly, and we have to assume that our third party tools do, this test everything without modifying the database.</p>\n<p>Because we’ve tested both the top half of the code and the bottom half of the code, we now have a reasonable assurance that the code as a whole works as it should.</p>\n",
