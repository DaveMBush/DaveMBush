One of the new controls that Visual Studio 2008 brings us is the ListView.  Now, the ListView control is really several different controls all rolled into one.  There is a lot to see with this control.  So, today is just going to be a small introduction.  We'll come back another day and do a presentation that goes deeper than we have time for today. So, what we are going to do here is put the control on the screen, show you the different presentations it can give you and then talk a little bit about how the new DataPager works with this control.
