As I've mentioned in other post, while I think LINQ has it's uses, I still favor the use of the ObjectDataSource control in conjunction with DataSets and a 3-tiered architecture.Â  Since any future demos I do will probably involve this architecture, I thought it would be useful to do a short demo that demonstrates how to create a 3-Tiered architecture in ASP.NET.
