![H02C0081](/uploads/2009/08/H02C0081.jpg "H02C0081") Several months ago, I mentioned that [I found a product that will allow you to create as many themes as you want](/2009/05/26/aspnet-web-design-software/) for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, ASP.NET, or regular HTML. I also mentioned that it did not do DotNetNuke. Well, now it does.  I think it was shortly after I wrote the original review that [Artisteer](/goto/Artisteer/1148/3) sent out a survey asking what we liked and what we didn’t like.  I told them it was great, but if they made it work for DotNetNuke it would be awesome. I must not have been the only one who said this because shortly after I filled out the survey, I got an email asking me to try the beta release that had DNN support. All they need to do now is update their main home page, but I can assure you, version 2.2 now has support for DNN if you get the “Standard Edition.” You can download a demo [here](/goto/Artisteer/1148/3), which I HIGHLY recommend you do.  You will get the full product features, but everything will be water-marked.  That will be enough for you to see that this works for your purposes prior to purchasing the real version.
