In a land called Codeville, where clean code was a thrill,
Lived a crafty coder named Ted, always ready for a skill.
One fine day, he set out to make a beast,
A creature named Flaparoo, from west to east.

<!-- more -->

The blueprint of Flaparoo, Ted's unique class,
Needed a constructor to come to pass.
A special method, indeed a neat tool,
Which gets called when a class instance begins to pool.

Now Ted was learned, he knew what to do,
The constructor's job is to initialize, true.
Setting properties to their default or given state,
He was careful, meticulous, not leaving it to fate.

But a thought occurred, a little sly,
"Could my constructor do more?", he let out a sigh.
Logic, calculations, actions anew,
Could they find a place in his Flaparoo?

Yet he paused, remembering lessons learned,
Complex constructors left his code churned.
Inheritance, polymorphism, often came to fray,
Base class logic could lead subclasses astray.

For if a constructor held logic within its mirth,
It might affect derived classes, giving issues birth.
Assumptions of properties, methods overwritten,
Led to unpredictable results, developers smitten.

And object initialization, that valuable guarantee,
Could be thrown into chaos, as he came to see.
Objects must be usable when the constructor was through,
Or else, the purpose of it, would be askew.

A constructor laden with tasks complex,
Can potentially throw exceptions, oh so vexed!
Who handles them? What of the object's state?
Such complications, it would certainly create.

And what of unit tests, those faithful friends?
With complex constructors, their patience ends.
Hard to set up, harder to predict,
Failed tests would come back to afflict.

Transparency and predictability, values held dear,
With convoluted constructors, they disappear.
Code should be easy to read, simple to chase,
Or else, debugging turns into a wild goose chase.

So Ted decided, in wisdom and grace,
To keep his constructor a simple base.
Flaparoo's properties, set and ready,
With a constructor pure, stable, and steady.

For extra tasks and logic, he used a different knack,
Patterns like Factory and Builder, had his back.
No need to overburden the constructor's role,
For cleaner code was always his goal.

And thus, the story of Ted, our coder so bright,
A constructor's tale, from morning to night.
Remember this fable, whenever you code,
Keep your constructors simple, for a smooth road!
