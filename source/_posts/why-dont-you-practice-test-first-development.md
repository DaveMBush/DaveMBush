[![...compile and registrate Csharp dll](//farm7.staticflickr.com/6012/6021140195_bc72406af3_q.jpg "compiling Csharp file")](//www.flickr.com/photos/jotrox/6021140195/)I would have said "Test Driven Development" but I want to make it clear that what I'm talking about is writing test first, or at least simultaneous to writing the code.  Not sometime after, even if that after is immediately after. Recently, I've been doing some Test First Development presentations and I'm finding a trend that I'd like for you to contribute more information to.  While just about everyone I talk to will say they believe that we should be practicing Test First Development, hardly anyone is actually doing it practicing Test First Development. So, the question I have to ask is, "Why?" So, leave me a comment and tell me why you aren't writing test code first.
