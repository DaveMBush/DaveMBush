For months now I have been suffering from the dreaded random computer freeze.  It has gotten progressively worse.  Everything I’ve tried to do to fix the problem has failed.  I know what you’re thinking too.  “Must be a virus.”  Yeah, except I have run multiple virus checkers and come up empty.  I read someplace else that maybe it was a driver issue.  OK, but which driver?  Memory?  I guess that is possible, but not likely.  I’ll admit that is one thing I didn’t check. The great thing about this issue is that it has caused me to write better code, because the code I’m currently working on would fail as it was writing to the database, even though the database is on the same computer.  So, now I make it try three times, with 2 minutes in between, before giving up.  Fortunately, it isn’t a routine that NEEDS to be fast.  In fact, it is better if it is not. ![image](/uploads/2015/11/image.png "image") 

Another Problem
---------------

I’ve also noticed, more recently, that the CTRL key on my keyboard doesn’t want to work.  CTRL-C and CTRL-V often result in “c” or “v” being typed out unless I’m really intentional about pressing the keys.  Not the best way to go about programming.  Fortunately, I’m not using this computer to do my regular work (I’m currently working on-site with the client’s computer).  So, for the little bit of usage, I could live with it.  Besides, I’m cheap. Now, when I first got [this keyboard](/backlitKeyboard), I was really impressed.  The backlit keyboard was cool, but what I really liked was the mechanical keys.  So much smoother.  So, I was a little disappointed when I was thinking about replacing it.  And if I did replace it, should I get another of the same kind, or should I get something else? So, I procrastinated.

Enough Is Enough!
-----------------

Finally, a couple of weeks ago, I got so tired of not being able to copy and paste correctly, that I broke down and went to Amazon to see what is currently available.  This is when the [Logitech Wave](/logitechWave) series caught my eye. I’ve always liked the idea of ergonomic keyboards, but when I’ve tried the split keyboard, I just didn’t like them.  Yes, maybe I could get used to one.  But, I don’t want to have to get used to one.  The Logitech Wave is a nice compromise.  It FEELS mostly like a regular keyboard because the keys aren’t split.  But it has a slight curve or wave (hence the name) that conforms to what your fingers want to do instead of making your fingers comply with a straight row of keys.

So What Is It Like?
-------------------

So far, I like it enough.  I can’t say if it helps with carpal tunnel because I don’t really suffer from that problem.  It is a keyboard, it wasn’t all that expensive. It is wireless, so I was able to get it setup without crawling under my desk (I did have to crawl under my desk to unplug the old keyboard!).  Honestly, the only issue I’ve had was during the setup.  I unpacked the keyboard and the mouse (it comes with a wireless mouse) and realized, I didn’t know where the receiver part was that plugs into a USB port.  I looked back in the box for it, was it in one of the bags I hadn’t opened yet?  No.  Hmm.  Where could it be? Oh, there it is.  Stuck in the cardboard.  Seriously, this thing is SO small, if you don’t pay attention, you could lose it.  And I almost did before I had ever even gotten it installed!

What’s This Got To Do With Computer Freezes?
--------------------------------------------

Over the rest of the day, I noticed, my computer isn’t freezing any more.  Maybe I’m just imagining things. But, I’ve been using this, as of this writing, for over a week.  I’ve used it for at least 2 hours every night.  I’m using it now to write this post.  I wrote last week’s post.  Seriously, my computer no longer freezes.  Whoda thunk?
